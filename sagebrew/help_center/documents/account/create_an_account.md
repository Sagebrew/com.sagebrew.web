# Why should I create an account? #
There are many exciting benefits and opportunities that come with your very 
own Sagebrew account! As the nation's new hub for real world
problem solving, a Sagebrew account is a great way to assure that your voice be 
heard. As a Sagebrew member you will receive the following benefits:

* The ability to directly communicate with those who represent you in public 
  office
* A simple and effective platform to collaborate with like-minded visionaries
* Track the progress and promises of your representatives and those running for 
  office
* Easily contribute to individuals running for public office in your area
* Work with others to find viable solutions to real world problems
* Ability to launch a campaign for public office

Most importantly, you should create a Sagebrew account because you have a 
burning desire to leave the world in a better state than when you came into it. 
That's really what makes a good person, isn't it? To discuss the big questions 
and promote a society that works to actively benefit all members? We like to 
think so, and we like to think that at the heart of each and every one of us 
there is a desire to make the world a better place. Sagebrew aims to help 
connect us with that desire and provides a platform for discussion and action. 

Happy brewing!
