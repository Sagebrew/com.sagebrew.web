# How do I reset my password? #
If you forget your password please go to the [Reset Your Password][1] page to 
reset it.

This page can also be reached through the ["Forgot your password?"][1] link 
provided on the Sagebrew homepage. 

Once you're on the page you will be asked to provide your 
registered Sagebrew email address and instructed to check your inbox. 
You will receive an email that will take you to a password reset page. 
Enter your new password and confirm it. 

Make sure that it's a password that you'll remember!
