# Why is the system asking me to wait a day or more before asking another question? #
1. If you have not yet achieved 10 reputation on Sagebrew, you are limited to 
   3 questions and solutions per day. This limit is in place to promote quality 
   questions and to ease new users into the system. You may have reached your 
   3 question limit for the day, and will need to wait until tomorrow before 
   posting another question. 

2. If you have more than 10 reputation and the system is asking you to wait a 
   day or more before asking another question, you have been posting too many 
   questions and need to slow your roll. We would like all Sagebrew 
   conversations to be meaningful and thoughtful, and if you're pumping out 
   20 questions a day we can reasonably expect that you've sacrificed quality 
   for quantity. Plus, we don't want to flood the floor with so many questions
   that the community doesn't have time to answer them all.
