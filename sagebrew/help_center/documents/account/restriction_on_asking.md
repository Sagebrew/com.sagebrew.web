# Why is the system asking me to wait a day or more before asking another question? #
1. If you have not yet achieved 10 [Reputation][1] on Sagebrew, you are limited to 
   3 questions and solutions per day. This limit is in place to promote quality 
   questions and to ease new users into the system. You may have reached your 
   3 question limit for the day, and will need to wait until tomorrow before 
   posting another question. 
2. If you have more than 10 reputation and the system is asking you to wait a 
   day or more before asking another question, you have been posting too many 
   questions and need to slow your roll. We would like all Sagebrew 
   conversations to be meaningful and thoughtful, and if you're pumping out 
   a lot of questions a day our systems take that into consideration, pairs it with a 
   grouping of other factors, and determines if it needs to throttle what it's 
   taking in. We don't want to flood the floor with so many questions
   that the community doesn't have time to provide solutions for them all.
