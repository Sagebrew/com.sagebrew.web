# What if I disagree with the closure of a question? How can I reopen it? #
If one of your Questions has been closed and you are unhappy with the decision 
of the Admin Council to close that Question, you may appeal to reverse that 
decision. Go to the Question and there will be a "Appeal Removal" button. 
Submit your appeal explaining why you believe the Question shouldn't be 
removed from the Public Conversation area. If your appeal is successful, 
the Question will be re-opened to posting Solutions and Comments. If your 
appeal is unsuccessful your Question will remain closed.
