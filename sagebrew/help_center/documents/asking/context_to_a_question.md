# Why is adding Context to Questions important? #
Providing context to Questions is important because context allows other 
users to fully understand your Question, where you're coming from, and gives 
them a base understanding of what research and prior thought has gone into 
your question. Context provides the who, what, where, when, and why of an 
issue and should include cited sources, such as [research studies][1], 
news articles, or articles from literary journals, to provide as much 
information on the topic as you think necessary to begin discussion. 
It's very beneficial for everyone to have the same basic understanding 
about an issue and why it exists as it does.
