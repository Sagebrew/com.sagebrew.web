# Why are some things marked as duplicate? #
If your question has been marked as a Duplicate it is because the 
same Question (or one very similar that is aimed at finding a Solution to 
the same issue) has already been asked and is in the midst of a discussion. 
The [Admin Council][1] closes duplicate questions to keep the site neat and 
focused. We then provide a link in the duplicate Question that takes users to 
the more prevalent Question. Duplicate questions divide the conversation between 
multiple parties, making it harder for a Solution to be reached. If we 
are all on the same page taking part in the same Conversation, it is easier 
to reach a Solution. Power in numbers!
