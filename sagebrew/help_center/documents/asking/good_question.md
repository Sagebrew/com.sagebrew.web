At Sagebrew we like to discuss problems. We have debates and listen to each other's
point of view to understand where those we disagree with are coming from. We like to
start these conversations off with a Question. Below you'll find some guidelines we
like to follow to get the most out of these conversations.

### Open Ended ###
Can you find a definitive answer on Google, like who won the Super Bowl, or is the 
Doge meme a Shiba Inu? If so it's probably not an open ended Question. A conversation
surrounding an issue that hasn't been solved yet and has many potential solutions 
is where it's at. For example "How do we end poverty in the European Union?" could be 
solved in a multitude of ways. Each having pros and cons that can be discussed and debated
to help others understand the problem better. Enabling people to converge behind solutions they
agree can fix the underlying problem.

### Metric Based Evidence ###
If you cannot find statistically supported evidence to support your question, you 
should propose that a proper study be conducted to shed further light 
on the situation. It is important to provide evidence based in metrics and studies.
Anecdotal evidence can help to relate the question to more people but using it alone to 
pose a question can often times lead to holes and misrepresentations of the issue being 
discussed. 

Creating good questions requires an interest in the topic of 
discussion, and the willingness to do a little bit of research to 
supplement your thoughts on the topic.
