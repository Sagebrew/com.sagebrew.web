# How do I create a good question? #
In order to know how to effectively create a "good question," we 
need to know what a "good question" is. Here at Sagebrew we define a 
good question as a question that contains most, if not all, of the following 
criteria:

## Open Ended ##
There should be no clear-cut solution to your question, 
and if there is, it probably shouldn't be posed. For example, 
a poor question that is not open ended might look like this: 

### Do high levels of atmospheric CO2 lend to the Greenhouse Effect? ###
This question is not open ended. There are no multiple sides to this question 
because science has shown that, yes, higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere 
directly lend to the Greenhouse Effect. We've observed this on our earth, as 
well as on other planets in our solar system such as Venus. This question is 
not a great question for Sagebrew. Instead, look for questions that haven't 
been fully explained or solved, questions that aren't a simple internet search 
away. For example: 

### What can the United States do to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions generated each year? ###
This question is open ended, and includes room for debate from multiple angles. 
It is also specific enough to dive really in depth without encompassing too 
much information. A question like this begs for multiple solutions and 
generates strong conversation around the topic of reducing CO2 emissions. 

## Fact based evidence ##
If you cannot find fact-based evidence to support your question, you 
should propose that a proper study be conducted to shed further light 
on the situation. It is important that any research and evidence you provide 
be fact-based and not anecdotal. Anecdotal evidence does have its place, and 
may add ethos to the situation, but fact-based evidence always supersedes 
anecdotal evidence. For example, a good question with poor evidence might look 
like:

### Can smoking marijuana cause lung cancer? ###
> Evidence: I am a father of three and a public health official from Michigan. 
> I think that smoking marijuana can cause lung cancer because my father 
> smoked marijuana and died of lung cancer.

Do you see how this man used anecdotal evidence to support an otherwise fair 
question? His evidence, one case of one person smoking marijuana and 
contracting lung cancer, is no good because it is only one case. There 
may have been a variety of other factors that led to the lung cancer, and 
until a proper study is conducted that eliminates these factors, we cannot 
assume that this man's father contracted lung cancer from smoking marijuana. 
A better question and supporting evidence might look like this: 

### Can frequent marijuana smoking lead to lung cancer? ###
> Evidence: There have been many studies that link marijuana smoking to lung 
> cancer, but many of them are unclear or contradictory. There was this 
> [systematic review][1] that concluded that further study and review is needed to reach 
> a better conclusion, and at this time there can be no causal 
> link between marijuana smoking and lung cancer.


This question and the supporting evidence are well rounded and thought out. 
The evidence is fact based and doesn't provide a clear solution so there is 
plenty of room for debate and further study. 

Creating good questions requires a valid interest in the topic of 
discussion, and the willingness to do a little bit of research to 
supplement your thoughts about the topic.
