# What types of Questions should I avoid asking? #
Questions to avoid asking on Sagebrew are Questions that

- Have a clear cut and simple answer
    - For example, don't ask why the sky is blue, or
 why tomatoes are acidic. These are questions that a simple
 internet search can answer. Sagebrew is for tough questions. Questions
 that don't have clear cut answers and questions that
 pose a moral or ethical problem. The goal of Sagebrew is for
 people to work together to solve problems.
- Questions that are inherently offensive or inappropriate.
 - Don't ask questions that target groups of people in a
 negative way, or otherwise threaten the safety/rights of
 groups of people or individuals
- Questions that lean heavily to one side without considering
the other side
    - For example, a Question such as "How can liberals justify
      killing unborn children?" is not the kind of Question
      you should ask on Sagebrew. This Question clearly targets
      liberals and does not take their point of view into consideration. A 
      better Question to ask might be "In the case of Abortions, what 
      constitutes life and how can we better prevent situations that lead to 
      abortions?" Or perhaps, "How can we better educate children to prevent 
      situations of unwanted pregnancy?"

Generally on Sagebrew you should strive to ask the difficult Questions
that have no clear cut answer. Questions should generate positive discussion
with the goal to improve a situation or issue.
