# What does it mean if a Conversation is "Seasoned"? #
A Seasoned Conversation is a Conversation in which a single Solution has 
achieved 1000+ Reputation, dictating that a very solid Solution has been 
proposed and further Conversation will likely be unnecessary. To Comment 
or add another Solution to a Seasoned Conversation you will have to have 
accumulated 100 or more Reputation. Admins can no longer place Protection 
on a Seasoned Conversation. 

It may prove beneficial for new users to peruse Seasoned Conversations to get 
an idea of what good discussion looks like.
