# What are Tags, and how should I use them? #
Tags are a system of topic organization and classification within Sagebrew's 
Conversation Area. You'll have the opportunity to Tag a Question before posting 
it with one or more of Sagebrew's following topics:

 - Fiscal
 - Foreign Policy
 - Science
 - Drugs
 - Energy
 - Health
 - Space
 - Education
 - Politics
 - Environment
 - Economic
 - Social
 - Defense
 - Agriculture
 
This will allow Sagebrew to classify your question according to your tags. 
It also makes it easier for other users to find your Question using 
Sagebrew's search engine. So, after creating a question you should find the 
appropriate tags to allocate your Question to. 
Once you've reached 1250 Reputation, you will gain the ability to create your 
own tags!

Also, Sagebrew will evenly allocate any Reputation gained on a Question into 
categories respective to your tags. For example: 

    Tom poses a Question about the effectiveness of increased Capital Gains Tax on 
    the wealthy and tags it with "Economic," and "Political." If he gains 
    120 Reputation from that Question, 60 of that Reputation will be tagged 
    "Economic," while the other 60 will be tagged "Political."

This system of Reputation allocation via Tags will help to lend credibility 
to users in specific fields. So Tom, an Economist, continues to ask good 
Questions and provide good Solutions in Conversations that are Tagged 
"Economic," his Reputation as a credible Economist will increase. 

If you're unable to find a Tag that directly matches your Question, use the 
Tag/Tags that most closely fit. Once a user reaches 1,250 Reputation they'll 
gain the ability to create new Tags. As the Sagebrew community grows, the 
diversity of Tags will increase and more options for Tagging will become 
available. 

Happy Tagging!
