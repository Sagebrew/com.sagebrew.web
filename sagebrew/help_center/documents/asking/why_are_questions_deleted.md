# Why and how are some questions deleted? #
There are a few reasons a question might be deleted on Sagebrew.

1. The question may have been flagged as containing offensive, inappropriate, 
or harmful language or images. 
2. The question may be a duplicate.
3. The question may have been of very low quality and/or without proper sources.

Before a question is deleted it must first be flagged. After a question is 
flagged, it is put up to a vote for the Admin Council. A 2/3 majority of 
participating Admins is required for a question to be deleted. If no action 
is taken within two days, a flagged question will be deleted.
