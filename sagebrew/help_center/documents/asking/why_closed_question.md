#What does it mean if a Question is Closed?

A closed Question is a Question that has been determined to be lacking depth by the Admin Council. These questions aren't deleted, but instead are closed off to further interaction (no more comments, solutions, upvotes or downvotes) and they may stand as examples of Questions that need improvement.
