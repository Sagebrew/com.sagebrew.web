# What does it mean if a Question is Closed? #

A closed Question is a Question that has been determined to be lacking depth by 
the [Admin Council][1]. These questions aren't deleted, but instead are closed 
off to further interaction (no more Comments, Solutions, Upvotes or Downvotes) 
so they may stand as examples of Questions that need improvement.
