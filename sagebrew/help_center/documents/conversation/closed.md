# What does it mean if something is Closed? #
When something is closed it means that no further interaction (no more 
Comments, Solutions, Upvotes, or Downvotes) can be had with the content.
This occurs when the Community [flags][1] something as lacking in depth or believes 
something is a [duplicate][2] and the [Admin Council][3] votes in two-thirds 
agreement with the flags.

These pieces of content aren't [deleted][4], but instead are kept around
so they may stand as examples of contributions that either need improvement or
to point the way to the original Conversation.
