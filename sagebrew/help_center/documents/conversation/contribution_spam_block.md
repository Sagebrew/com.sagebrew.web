# Why has my contribution been removed due to 'spam'? #
In order for a contribution to be [removed][1] due to "[spam][2]" a couple things must 
happen. Another user must [Flag][3] your contribution as spam. The [Admin 
Council][4] must then vote on the Flag and decide that, yes, it is spam. A 2/3 
majority among participating Admins is required to remove a contribution.
You will then receive a notification that your contribution has been blocked 
due to spam. 

If multiple pieces of content are labeled as spam in this way, your 
account will be suspended from adding additional contributions to the Public 
Conversation.
