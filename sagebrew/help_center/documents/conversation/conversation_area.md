# What is the Conversation Cloud? #
The Conversation Cloud is the place to be on Sagebrew! It's where all of the 
public conversations take place, offering the ability to pose Questions 
and Solutions, garner traffic for your Missions, and bring people together 
to solve the issues they care about. In the 
Conversation Cloud you'll see conversations in your area as well as 
national conversations. You'll also be able to search the 
Conversation Cloud for existing conversations via the search bar. Conversation
topics are endless and can range from environmental to health and 
financial to pothole repair.

The stakes in the Conversation Cloud are higher as [Reputation][1] is on the line. 
This is a good thing! Great conversation will be rewarded with reputation 
gains, while poor conversation is discouraged through reputation loss. 
So just remember when contributing in the Conversation Cloud that your ideas and 
attitude are on public display. Let's start a conversation!
