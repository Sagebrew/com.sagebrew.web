# Why and how are some contributes deleted? #
For a contribution to be deleted, it must have been [flagged][1] by the Community
as spam or for containing offensive, inappropriate, or harmful language or 
images. It could have also been caught and flagged by Sagebrew's system for 
the same reasons and brought to the attention of the [Admin Council][2].

Before a flagged piece of content is deleted it must be put up to a vote for the 
Admin Council. A 2/3 majority of participating Admins is required for a 
piece of content to be deleted. If multiple users are flagging the content and no 
decisive action has been taken by the Admin Council then there will be an overlay
placed on the contribution indicating it may contain inappropriate material,
until the Admin Council acts.

Contributions may also be deleted if Sagebrew discovers that a contribution, or any 
component of a it, is plagiarized, illegal, patented, or otherwise 
belongs solely to another individual or organization. If a contribution is found to
violate any of these there will not be an Admin Council vote for removal and 
further action may be taken against the user who posted the material.
