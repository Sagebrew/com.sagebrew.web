# What does it mean if a Conversation is "Protected"? #
A Protected Conversation is a Conversation that has been around for at least a 
day and a member from the [Admin Council][1] has deemed "Protected." What 
this means is that in order to further contribute to the Conversation, a user 
must have at least 50 [Reputation][3]. A conversation may become Protected if:

- It is generating excess Spam
- There are no relevant new Solutions being posed
- A Solution has been determined, but it has not yet received 1000+ Upvotes


If a Solution reaches 1000+ Upvotes it becomes [Seasoned][2].
