# What's the difference between a public and private conversation? #
A public conversation is a conversation that anyone with a Sagebrew account 
can view and partake in. Public Conversations are meant to include as many 
voices and ideas as possible. You should never post something in a Public 
Conversation that you don't want to be public knowledge. By participating in 
a Public Conversation you take the risk of gaining or losing [Reputation][1] for 
your contributions. 

A Private Conversation is a conversation that only those on your friends list 
can see or take part in. You can adjust the privacy settings in your account 
settings panel to manage who can see your conversations within your friends 
list. You will not gain or lose Reputation for participating in a Private 
Conversation.
