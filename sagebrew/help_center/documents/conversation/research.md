# Research Study Methods and Value #
Let's begin by distinguishing between Evidence-Based and Eminence-Based 
research. 
**Evidence-Based Research** is research that uses quantitative information based 
on a narrow set of criteria to determine facts. Evidence based studies allow us 
to separate facts from fiction by relying only on what we have bodies of 
evidence to support, and testing what we hypothesize through systematic trials. 

**Eminence-Based Research** is research that accounts for qualitative information 
such as a case study, or anecdotal evidence. Eminence based studies give great 
insight into one case, but provide little to no evidence to link a cause and
effect because the scope of the experience is too subjective. Eminence based 
research has its place, but is superseded by Evidence-Based research when 
available. 

## Evidence-Based Research ##
### Case Control Studies ###
Case control studies are observational studies that examine one instance of a 
condition, issue or problem and compare it to similar instances where there was 
no condition, issue or problem. Case Control Studies rely on observational and 
retrospective data to draw conclusions. Case Control Studies provide little 
hard evidence but are an important first step in diagnosing a problem and can 
help to narrow the possible causes of an issue and shed some light into the 
issue itself.  

#### Limitations/Reservations ####
When should Case Control Studies be cited?

* When there is little to no relevant research on a topic 
* When there has only been a few instances of an issue
* When no Cohort Studies, Controlled Clinical Trials, or Random Controlled 
  Clinical Trials are available on a particular issue
* To shed some light on a relatively unknown issue
* When a Controlled Clinical Trial might be unethical


### Cohort Studies ###
Cohort Studies are observational studies in which a group of individuals who are
either already affected by an issue or are currently being affected by an issue 
are analyzed and compared to similar individuals not affected by said issue. 
Cohort Studies are usually conducted in the medical field, and attempt to 
analyze a group of patients who exhibit a similar condition, and compare them 
to healthy individuals that live the same lifestyle. Cohort Studies provide 
more evidence for causation than Case Control Studies, but are still incomplete 
because of individual bias. They don't narrow the causation down to a 
certainty, but give greater insight than Case Control Studies and 
Eminence-Based Studies. 

#### Limitations/Reservations ####
When should Cohort Studies be cited?

* When no Controlled Clinical Trials or Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials 
  are available
* When dealing with a relatively unknown issue 
* Instances in which Controlled Clinical Trials or Randomized Controlled 
  Clinical Trials might be unethical or impractical

### Controlled Clinical Trials ###
Controlled Clinical Trials are observational studies in which two groups, 
a test group and a control group, are utilized to determine possible causation 
of an instance. One group (the test group) is administered an intervention 
(whether it be medical, chemical, economic, ecologic or otherwise) and compared 
against the other group (the control group). Meticulous data is then collected 
on both groups in an effort to draw a link between the intervention and a 
hypothesized outcome. In Controlled Clinical Trials the groups are informed 
which group they belong to, and therefore the results will not be conclusive 
enough to undeniably prove causation, however, Controlled Clinical Trials are 
still very useful, especially when a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial may 
be unethical or impractical.    

#### Limitations/Reservations ####
When should Controlled Clinical Trials be cited?

* When no Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials are available
* When a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial may be unethical or impractical 

### Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ####
Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials are the gold standard for researching 
causation. In a randomized Controlled Clinical Trial two (or more) groups are 
assigned completely at random, usually including as many varying factors as 
possible (gender, age, race etc) and are analyzed and tested in an attempt 
to prove or disprove causation. Randomized Controlled Trials are the only 
trials in which causation can be undeniably proved, and supersede all other 
research trials when available. 

#### Limitations/Reservations ####
Cannot be conducted in instances where ethical values are challenged. For 
example, it would be unethical to perform a Randomized Controlled Clinical 
Trial to discover causation between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer, because
asking a random group of individuals to submit themselves (knowingly or 
unknowingly) to a study that might cause lung cancer in half the participants 
is just wrong. Therefore, Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials will not always 
be available. 

When should Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials be cited?

* Whenever possible: these trials deliver hard, conclusive evidence of causation
 
### Double Blind Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ###
Double Blind Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials are just like Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials, but in these trials not even the conductors of the trial know which participants recieve the placebo. This removes any bias that might result on behalf of those conducting the experiment. 

#### Limitations/Reservations ####
Same as Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials. 

When should Double Blind Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials be cited?

*Whenever possible: these trials deliver hard, conclusive evidence of causation


### Systematic Reviews ###
Systematic Reviews are literature reviews that attempt to identify, select, 
appraise, and synthesize all quality research that has been done on a 
particular issue or question in an effort to answer a greater question about 
that issue. Systematic Reviews are fantastic because they eliminate the need 
to sift through poor-quality research because they provide an excellent 
compilation of all available high-quality research. 

#### Limitations ####

When should Systematic Reviews be cited?
* Whenever applicable: these reviews provide all current fact-based 
  evidence on any particular issue, often including multiple Randomized 
  Controlled Clinical Trials
* When Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials have been conducted, but 
  there are still questions about the issue to be answered


### Meta-Analysis ###
A Meta-Analysis is a collection of all available research on any given topic 
that attempts to compile all data, examine any differences or variations 
within the different studies, and compare outcomes in an attempt to further 
narrow the set of criteria and shed further light onto a topic. Meta-analysis 
is pretty much a research on all previous research, and will highlight all 
variations of previous research. Meta-analyses takes all types of studies 
into account, including Systematic Reviews, and organizes it into easily 
decipherable statistical data. 


#### Limitations ####
When should a Meta-Analysis study be utilized?

* When results from multiple Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials don't agree
* When multiple studies, even similar studies, reach different conclusions
* When it may be pertinent to examine all possible research on a topic

## Eminence-Based Research ##
### Anecdotal Evidence ###
Anecdotal Evidence is subjective evidence based on a personal experience. 
Anecdotal evidence has its place, and is certainly valued in a subjective 
manor, but provides no hard facts about causation because it is merely a 
personal account of an incident or issue. Anecdotal Evidence should never 
be used to prove something as fact, and should rarely (if ever) be used when 
quality Evidence-Based research has been conducted.

#### Limitations ####
Anecdotal Evidence is purely subjective, and only offers insight into one 
person's view/beliefs about an issue or situation. Anecdotal Evidence is 
never enough to prove causation and is mostly useful for speculation. 


When should Anecdotal Evidence be cited? 
* When it adds proper emotion or face value to an issue or situation
* When looking for multiple perspectives or instances of an issue or situation
* When no objective study or research has been conducted on an issue and an 
  individual is appealing for an objective study or more research to be 
  performed

**Note:** Using anecdotal evidence alone in a Conversation without any additional 
supporting research will most likely be flagged by the Community, reviewed by 
the [Admin Council][1] and potentially removed, resulting in loss of [Reputation][2].
Basing one's Solution, Question, or Comment on a single piece of anecdotal 
evidence has little weight (except when debunking the usage of absolutes)
and leaves the Community wanting additional support to add depth, [context][3], 
and further analysis to the given observation. 

### Case Studies ###
Case Studies are retrospective studies done that examine one particular case 
of an issue or situation. Case studies are highly subjective as they only 
analyze one instance of an issue or situation, and are superseded by all 
Evidence-Based Research.

#### Limitations ####
Case Studies offer only a small insight into an issue. They are often great 
launching points for further, Evidence-Based research, but on their own provide 
no causal evidence. 

When should Case Studies be cited?

* To supplement Evidence-Based Studies and put a face to an issue that might 
  trigger further interest and further study
