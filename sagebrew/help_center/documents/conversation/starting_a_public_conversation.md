# How do I start a conversation? #
To start a public conversation, navigate to the 
Conversation Cloud by clicking it in the navigation bar. 
Once you're in the Conversation Cloud you'll want to look 
around and see if a conversation is already being had regarding the topic you 
have a Question on. If there isn't click the "Start a Conversation" button.
You will be taken to a page where you can enter your Question and the 
[Context][3] for it. There are four sections for you to enter information:

* "Question Title" is for the actual Question you are posing. 
* "Question Context" is where you will provide relevant information 
  that you've [researched][1] that provides background to your Question. 
* "What Place is Affected?" is where you can indicate what location your Question relates to.
  This could be the anything from the city you live in to an entire country.
* "Add Tags" is where you can enter in up to 5 tags that relate to the Question to help
  others to find it.

Check out the [Participate in the Conversation][2] article for
best practices and more information.

After you click "Submit" your question will go public in the Conversation Cloud
and you will receive notifications whenever someone poses a Solution or 
a Comment is added to your Question.
