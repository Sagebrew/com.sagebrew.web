# How do I start a public conversation? #
To start a public conversation, navigate to the Public 
Conversation Area by clicking the 
<img src="{% static 'media/conversation.svg' %}" alt="conversation" 
style="width: 20px; background: #838c92; padding-bottom:5px;"/> in the 
navigation bar. Once you're in the Public Conversation Area you'll want to look 
around and see if a Conversation is already being had regarding the topic you 
have a Question on. If there isn't click the "Spark a Conversation" button.
You will be taken to a page where you can enter your Question and the 
[Context][3] for it. There are two sections for you to enter information, 
the "Question title" space is for the actual Question you are posing. 
The "Question Context" space is where you will 
provide relevant information that you've [researched][1] that provides background 
to your Question. Check out the [Participate in the Conversation][2] article for
best practices and more information.

After you click "Submit" your question will go live in the Public Conversation 
Area and you will receive notifications whenever someone poses a Solution or 
a Comment is added to your Question.
