# Why have my Questions or Solutions been blocked due to 'spam'? #
In order for a question to be blocked due to "spam" a couple things must 
happen. Another user must Flag your Question or Solution as spam. The [Admin 
Council][1] must then vote on the Flag and decide that, yes, it is spam. A 2/3 
majority among participating Admins is required to block a Question or 
Solution. You will then receive a notification that your Question or 
Solution has been blocked due to spam. 

If multiple Questions and/or Solutions are labeled as spam in this way, your 
account will be blocked from adding additional contributions to the Public 
Conversation.
