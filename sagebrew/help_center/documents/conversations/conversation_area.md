# What is the Conversation Area? #
The Conversation area is the place to be on Sagebrew! It's where all of the 
Public Conversations will take place, offering the ability to pose Questions 
and Solutions, bringing people together to solve worldly problems. In the 
Conversation area you'll see trending Conversations in your area as well as 
trending national Conversations. You'll also be able to search the 
Conversation area for existing Conversations via the search bar. There are a 
number of Conversation topics ranging from Environmental to Health to 
Financial.

The stakes in the Conversation area are higher as Reputation is on the line. 
This is a good thing! Great conversation will be rewarded with reputation 
gains, while poor conversation is discouraged through reputation loss. 
While reputation is by no means a direct indicator of the quality of a 
conversation, it does offer enough incentive to provide meaningful insight. 
So just remember when contributing in the conversation area that your ideas and 
attitude are on public display. Let's start a conversation!
