A Quest is your public portfolio, tracking all of the Missions or public service 
you've taken part in.
This includes running for public office, serving, being part of an advocacy movement, 
or leading your own. 

## Quest Purpose ##
A Quest serves as a place for anyone to showcase what Mission's they've been on, are 
currently waging, or have endorsed. Your Quest helps others find out what you're working 
towards and enables them to easily donate or volunteer to assist you with the causes they
agree with.

## Mission Purpose ##
A Mission is the target you're working towards. It's the place where you can outline 
what you're advocating or running for. People can donate, volunteer, and endorse your
Missions to help you achieve your goals. 


## What Does a Mission Provide? ##
#### Public Page ####
Each Mission you start receives a public page we like to call your Epic. This is
where you can detail your campaign platform if you're running for an office or 
the agenda of your advocacy movement. This is the place to capture potential supporter's 
interest and express the issues you're trying to fix.

#### Updates ####
Updates are like a blog but they go out to all of your supporters, people that have 
followed your Quest, donated to your Mission, or volunteered to assist you. You can 
post anything you believe your supporters will care about and don't have to worry about 
troll comments or downvotes hijacking your update.

#### About ####
A Mission's About is a 128 character statement describing itself. This is a quick snippet that 
will be displayed on the public page as well as any forms people use to support the Mission, 
like donations and volunteering.

#### Donations ####
It's hard to get things done in today's political world without money. That's why
we give every Mission the ability to raise donations from supporters through easy
to use, predefined forms that help advocates and politicians alike succeed in their 
endeavours.

#### Volunteers ####
Being alone isn't fun and trying to accomplish something without any help is a 
daunting task. That's why Sagebrew helps to connect you and your Mission with 
people who support your cause and want to volunteer to help you. Like donations 
we provide an easy to use form to people to enable them to volunteer to help out 
in a variety of ways.
