After you've donated to a Mission you will receive an email containing
a receipt for the donation you just submitted. 

As soon as you click donate we also start the process of getting the money you donated to
the Mission you donated to. We'll direct deposit it into their account as soon as the Banks 
let us so that they can continue to fund and excel at the cause you both care about.
