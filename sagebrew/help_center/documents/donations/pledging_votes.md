# Why we think you should pledge a vote for your Representative #
Sagebrew's pledging system offers the unique and interesting opportunity for 
users to pledge their vote to a candidate running for office. Pledging a vote 
is akin to assuring your representative that come election day, they'll have 
your vote at the polls. The act of pledging a vote benefits both the 
representatives and the citizens they represent. 

* The representative can more accurately judge the support they have during 
  campaign season and adjust campaign strategy accordingly. If a representative 
  can see that they have a lot of support, it might encourage them to run or to 
  continue with confidence.
* Also, some representatives may choose not to run unless they receive a certain 
  number of pledged votes. This is an easy way to let a representative know that 
  they can count on your support and show them that they have a shot at winning. 


We think that it's important to foster a community of trust and openness, and
we highly encourage all members of the Sagebrew community to pledge their votes 
with full intention of casting those votes come election day. In a community 
where the citizens can effectively communicate with those responsible for 
representing them, it will be easier to tend to the will of the people. So go 
on a head, do your research and pledge your vote!!
