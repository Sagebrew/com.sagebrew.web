# Can I advertise on Sagebrew? #
Sagebrew does not host third party advertising. Third party 
advertising clutters websites and can compromise the quality of a website, 
pulling focus from the content of the website itself. We would like to 
maintain an advertisement free community where the primary goal of Sagebrew, 
instigating change and conversation, is the focus of the Sagebrew. Another 
reason we would like to remain advertisement free is to keep ourselves as 
neutral as possible, giving fair voice to all parties interested in the 
website. To advertise for one side of the spectrum simply because they
have the funds to advertise wouldn't be fair to any opposition.
