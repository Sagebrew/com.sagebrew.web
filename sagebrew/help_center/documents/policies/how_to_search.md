# How do I search? #
There is a search bar at the top of each page. This search bar recognizes what 
page you're on and adjusts results accordingly. If you're on your Profile Page 
you're search will focus by default on Friends and other users while also 
providing the ability to see Conversations and other topics with a single click.
If you're in the Conversation Area our search will default to focusing on 
finding Conversations related to your search while making Friends and Users a 
available in an additional tab you can easily click over to. By clicking 
on the search bar you can type in keywords related to your inquiry and hit 
enter to search.
