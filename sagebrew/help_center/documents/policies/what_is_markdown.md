# What is Markdown? #
Markdown is a formatting language in which plain text can be easily converted 
to HTML and other web formats. Markdown makes it simple to organize and format 
information. It also allows for code injection, so those tech savvy among 
us can tweak and format to even greater specificity. Some format options that
Markdown offers:

- Headers
- Ordered Lists
- Bold
- Italics
- Linking
- Block Quotes
- Images 
- Preformatted Text
