## Description ##
Congratulations! You’re now a Brewmaster, one of our most trusted members! 
With this awesome title comes a great responsibility. You now have the ability 
to step behind the scenes at Sagebrew and join the ranks of the Admins by 
joining the [Admin Council][1]. We’re relying on you to guide the Sagebrew 
community and to lead through example.

## What does this mean? ##
- You can now access the Admin Panel
- You’ll be able to review [Flagged][2] Questions, Solutions, and Comments, 
  determining whether or not they merit deletion, closure, or are harmless. 
  The Admin Council works a little like a democracy. All Flagged posts are 
  brought to the Admin Panel where they can vote on them. A 2/3 majority 
  among Admins who vote on Flagged posts is required before a Flagged post be 
  [deleted][3] or [closed][4]. If a Flagged post is left untouched for two days 
  it will automatically be deleted or closed.
- Close [duplicate][5] Questions
- You may now create 3 [Reach Posts][6] per week. A Reach Post is a post 
  that gets shared with your entire city. Use these wisely. 

## Limitations ##
Admin and up privileges suspended if you open a representative account or are 
elected to office. Also if you are a spouse of an elected official your 
moderator privileges shall be suspended for the length of their service to 
their country.
