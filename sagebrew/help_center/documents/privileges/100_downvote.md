# Ability to Downvote #
*Reputation needed: 100*
## Description ##
You now have the ability to Downvote Questions and/or Solutions. This is a way 
to express to another member that their question or Solution is either poorly 
crafted or contains mostly opinion and judgment rather than fact. These 
should be reserved for situations that you feel really merit a Downvote.

## When should I Downvote? ##
You can Downvote a Solution if you think it is a seriously wrong solution. 
For example, if there's a Question posed about how to deal with the crisis in 
Ukraine and one of the Solutions is pro-military invasion and highlights the 
historical context of military invasion and past issues with Russia etc, and 
you are a dire pacifist, than you may want to Downvote that Solution. 

## Why do I lose Reputation? I'm trying to help! ##
We don't want people mass Downvoting Questions and Solutions, i.e. ganging up 
simply to remove the credibility of the opposite side. All sides deserve to be 
heard to some degree. Also, we'd much rather you participate in the actual 
discussion by leaving a comment or adding an Solution of your own.

## Limitations ##
- You will have 15 overall Downvotes per day
- An additional 10 Downvotes will be provided per day for questions only
- Downvoting solutions costs you 2 reputation and removes 10 from the author
- Downvoting questions removes 2 reputation from the questioner
- Downvoting comments removes 1 reputation from the commenter
