# Ability to Downvote #
*Reputation needed: 100*
## Description ##
You now have the ability to Downvote Questions, Solutions, and Comments. This is a way 
to express to another member that you disagree with their contribution. 
Downvotes are for questions or solutions that aren't flawed in their logic, 
but that you think simply won't work. Think of Downvotes like an anonymous 
disagreement. 

## When should I Downvote? ##
You can Downvote a Question when you don't believe it is relevant, warrants 
further conversation, or if you just disagree with its premise. You should Downvote
Solutions if you disagree with them. For example, if there's a Question
posed about how to deal with the crisis in Ukraine and a Solution is 
pro-military invasion. The Solution highlights the historical context of 
military invasion and past issues with Russia, laying out a valid position. 
But you are a dire pacifist, than you should Downvote that Solution.

## Limitations ##
- You will have 15 overall Downvotes per day
- An additional 10 Downvotes will be provided per day for questions only
- Downvoting Solutions costs you 2 [Reputation][1] and removes 10 from the author
- Downvoting Questions removes 2 Reputation from the questioner
- Downvoting Comments removes 1 Reputation from the commenter

## Why do I lose Reputation when downvoting Solutions? ##
We don't want people mass Downvoting Questions, Solutions, or Comments, i.e. ganging up 
simply to remove the credibility of the opposite side. All sides deserve to be 
heard to some degree. Also, we'd much rather you participate in the actual 
discussion by leaving a Comment or adding a Solution of your own.
