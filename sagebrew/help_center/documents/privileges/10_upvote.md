# Ability to Upvote #
*Reputation needed: 10*
## Description ##
Youâ€™re fairly familiar with the site and how it works. To get more involved 
you now have the ability to Upvote questions and solutions on the Conversation 
platform. Upvote the questions and solutions that you believe to be high 
quality, effective additions to the ongoing conversation. The more Upvotes a
post gets, the more traffic that post will get.

## What should I use Upvoting for? ##
Upvote questions and solutions that provide relevant content to the ongoing 
discussion. If you find an solution to be particularly helpful give it an Upvote 
and help raise awareness of that solution. If you think a particular question 
merits more traffic, give it an Upvote to help it on its way.

## What happens when I Upvote? ##
When you Upvote a question or solution you have expressed interest in that 
question or solution. Upvoting doesn't harm you, and in fact, may help you 
acquire Badges!
