# Ability to Upvote #
*Reputation needed: 10*

## Description ##
Youâ€™re fairly familiar with the site and how it works. To get more involved 
you now have the ability to Upvote Questions, Solutions, and Comments on in the Public
Conversation Area. Upvote the Questions that you believe are 
important topics that you'd like to see conversation surround. Upvote Solutions
you believe are the best out of those provided. The more Upvotes a
conversation gets, the more traffic that conversation will get.

## What should I use Upvoting for? ##
Upvoting is our way of enabling you to express your agreement or interest on a 
given contribution. If you find an Solution to be particularly helpful give it an Upvote 
and help raise awareness of that solution. If you think a particular Question 
merits more traffic, give it an Upvote to help it on its way. If you believe a 
Comment should be used to improve a Solution or Question give it an Upvote.

## What happens when I Upvote? ##
When you Upvote a Question or Solution you have expressed interest in that 
Question or Solution. Upvoting doesn't harm you, and in fact, may help you 
acquire Badges!

## Can people see my Upvotes? ##
In the Public Conversation Area people cannot see how you are voting, this 
ensures that you are able to vote based on what you think is best rather than
how your vote will look. Please note in Private Areas such as your Profile Page
your friends will be able to see what you Upvote and Downvote.
