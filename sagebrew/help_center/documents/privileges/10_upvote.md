# Ability to Upvote #
*Reputation needed: 0*

## Description ##
Upvote the Questions that you believe are 
important topics that you'd like to see conversation surround. Upvote Solutions
you believe are the best out of those provided. The more Upvotes a
conversation gets, the more traffic that conversation will get.

## What should I use Upvoting for? ##
Upvoting is our way of enabling you to express your agreement or interest on a 
given contribution. If you find a Solution to be particularly helpful give it an Upvote 
and help raise awareness of that solution. If you think a particular Question 
merits more traffic, give it an Upvote to help it on its way. If you believe a 
Comment should be used to improve a Solution or Question give it an Upvote.

## What happens when I Upvote? ##
When you Upvote a Question or Solution the author of that content receives additional 
reputation. The author will also receive a notification that someone upvoted thier 
content but they will not be able to see who it was that did so.

## Can people see my Upvotes? ##
In the Conversation people cannot see how you are voting, this 
ensures that you are able to vote based on what you think is best rather than
how your vote will look. Please note voting on private content such as Posts is 
viewable by your friends but only your friends any no one else.
