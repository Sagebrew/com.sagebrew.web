# Add Explicit Content #
*Reputation needed: 250*
## Description ##
You’ve become familiar with the Conversation Cloud and you’ve proven that you 
can create quality Questions, Solutions, and Comments. Now you can add Explicit 
Content to one of your posts per week. This includes graphic photos or videos 
that enhance the severity of your posed issue. These will appear 
blacked-out with a warning on everyone’s display until they choose to 
view it. 

## Why post Explicit Content? ##
In some cases Explicit Content may help you to get your point across. For 
example, if you're making a humanitarian appeal about the blood diamond 
industry and the civil wars in Africa, it may be helpful for you to add 
a picture of a wounded or maimed soldier, or a child slave sifting through 
the rivers for diamonds. 

## When not to post Explicit Content? ##
Don't post Explicit Content if it has nothing to do with the integrity of the 
conversation. No offensive racial, religious, cultural, or gender 
orientation images, please. And please, please, please: no pornography. 
Violations will be [Flagged][1] as inappropriate and you may lose this
privilege.
