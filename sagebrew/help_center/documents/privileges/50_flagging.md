# Ability to Flag Content #
*Reputation needed: 50*
## Description ##
By now you should be familiar with the Conversation system and proper etiquette 
for discussion. With this power invested in you, this ability to Flag content, 
youâ€™ll be able to Flag Questions, Solutions and Comments that clearly disregard 
proper discussion etiquette. We're counting on you, the Sagebrew community, to 
assist us in keeping the Conversation Area clean and meaningful. 

## When should you Flag content? ##
When a Question, Solution, or Comment clearly disregards etiquette or steers 
the Conversation away from the original intent of the Question.

### Examples ###
- Content that uses inappropriate/offensive language
- Content that does not add to the Solution in any way
- Content that does not cite proper sources
- Content that is opinionated without credit or merit
- Content that has already been covered. No duplicate posts please.
- Content that only provides anecdotal evidence.
- Content that has veered away from the original purpose/issue at hand

## What happens to Flagged content? ##
When content is flagged it is put up for review by the [Admin Council][1] who 
will examine the content and vote on whether or not it is indeed inappropriate. 
A 2/3 majority is needed to [remove][3] or [close][4] Flagged posts.   

## Limitations ##
- You'll have 2 Flags per day. The number of Flags per day will increase with 
  your [Reputation][2] up to a maximum of 15 Flags
- You'll gain an additional Flag every 750 Reputation earned
- You'll gain an additional Flag for every 5 helpful Flags. A helpful Flag 
  is a Flag that is reviewed by the Sagebrew Admin Council and successfully 
  removed or closed
- Flagged content that is deleted results in the author of the Flagged content 
  losing all Reputation gained as a result of that content plus an additional 
  loss of 10 Reputation
- Flagged content that is not deleted results in the author of the Flagged 
  content losing no Reputation
- If a user's content is successfully Flagged three separate times in one month 
  that user will have all privileges suspended for 2 weeks
- If a user flags a piece of content and the motion is not supported by the 
  Admin Council the flagger will lose Reputation equal to that of all of the
  Reputation that would have been lost by the contributor had the flag been 
  successful, plus an additional loss of 30 Reputation
- If a user flags three different pieces of content in a week and none of them
  result in the Admin Council approving the flag the flagger will have their 
  Flag Privilege suspended for 2 weeks
