Updates are like your Mission's Blog. You can post information about what's going 
on with the campaign or movement, upcoming events, or information you think
your followers, contributors, volunteers, and constituents will find interesting.
Updates use the same [Markdown][3] system that you use in your [Epic][6] and in the 
[Conversation Cloud][7]. Also as alluded to above when you create an Update and 
your Mission is live the Update will be broadcast to the following users:

* Followers
* Contributors to your Mission
* People who have Volunteered to your Mission
* Political Mission Only: Constituents who can vote for your Position
* Advocacy Mission Only: People Located Within Your Advocacy's Affected Area

## How to Create a New Update ##
To create a new Update navigate to your Mission's settings and select the Updates
navigation link.

![navigate to updates management console][1]


From here you'll be able to create an Update just like you create a Question or 
Edit your Epic.

## How to Edit an Update ##
Editing an update can be done by clicking on the gear located on the existing 
update. This can be found either on the Updates page itself or within your Update
management console under "Previous Updates".

## Closing ##
Updates are a great way to keep in touch with your supporters. They give you an 
easy way to interact with them without the worry of people hijacking your post. 
They're also a great way to drive repeat donations and to increase turnout for an 
event.

If you have any questions or run into any issues let us know by clicking on 
the ![Chat Bubble][5] and we'll help get them resolved.
