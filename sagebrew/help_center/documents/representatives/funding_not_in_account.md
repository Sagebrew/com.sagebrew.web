# I've reached my Donation Goal but there are no funds in my bank account #
There are a couple reasons your funds aren't yet in your
bank account.

- You have not provided your constituents with an update for
  your previous Donation Goal. Donors will not provide their donations unless
  you're providing updates of your progress with the funding you've
  raised thus far.

- It may take up to two full business days for the transfer
  to process and show up in your account depending on bank policies. If it has 
  been more than two days and the funding still hasn't transferred, 
  reach out to us by opening your Intercom (the little question mark 
  on the bottom right of your screen).

If you have any other issues with fundraising or other portions of 
Sagebrew we're always happy to help! We love to hear from you, please 
don't be shy about using the Intercom.
