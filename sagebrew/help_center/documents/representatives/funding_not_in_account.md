# I've received a Donation but there are no funds in my bank account #
It may take up to two full business days for the transfer
to process and show up in your account depending on bank policies. If it has 
been more than two days and the funding still hasn't transferred, 
reach out to us by clicking the ![Chat Bubble][2] in the bottom right corner 
of your browser window.

If you have any other issues with fundraising or portions of the site
we're always happy to help! We always love to hear from you, please 
don't be shy about chatting us up with the ![Chat Bubble][2].
