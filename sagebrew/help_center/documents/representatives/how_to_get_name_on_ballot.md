# How do I get my name on the ballot? #
To get your name on the ballot for a federal election, you must
register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The text
below is taken straight from the FEC [website][1]

> If you are running for the U.S. House, Senate or the Presidency,
> you must register with the FEC once you (or persons acting on your behalf)
> receive contributions or make expenditures in excess of $5,000. Within 15
> days of reaching that $5,000 threshold, you must file a Statement of Candidacy
> authorizing a principal campaign committee to raise and spend funds on your behalf.
> Within 10 days of that filing, your principal campaign committee must submit a
> Statement of Organization. Your campaign will thereafter report its receipts and
> disbursements on a regular basis.

Once you've registered, you must go to your Secretary of State (or appropriate 
election office in your state). They will assist you in getting your 
name on the ballot. For more information regarding federal campaign 
procedure, visit the [Federal Election Commission website][1].
