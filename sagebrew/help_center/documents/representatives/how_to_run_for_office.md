# How to run for office #
It seems as though there aren't many single sources that outline the process of 
running for office. Let's remedy that! Let's create a character....Mona. Mona 
is the superintendent of her district's school system and an ardent achiever. 
She has thought long and hard about the problems she encounters on a daily 
basis in her State, and has decided to run for office. She has set her sights 
on a seat in the senate and campaign season is just around the corner. How will 
she go about campaigning?

## Testing the waters ##
Before registering as a candidate, Mona wants to test the waters to see if 
she's got enough support to make a viable bid. She can raise up to $5000 or 
spend up to $5000 without needing to register. This $5000 dollar cushion is 
the registration threshold. It acts as a precursor to a campaign so candidates 
like Mona can "test the waters" so to speak without having to register. Her 
next move while testing the waters is to put together a prospective campaign 
committee.

## Put together a campaign committee ##
First Mona will carefully select her campaign committee. This team will be 
responsible for handling the day to day affairs of the campaign and are crucial 
to the success of a campaign. Mona will want to choose her team wisely. A 
campaign team typically consists of:

- Campaign Manager
    - A Campaign Manager should be organized, meticulous, and proactive. This 
      person will supervise each aspect of the campaign and coordinate all 
      campaign activity.
- Treasurer
    - The Treasurer is responsible for tracking all monetary transactions 
      within a campaign to insure that all funding is properly allocated and 
      accounted for.
- Fundraiser
    - This person will be responsible for overseeing the raising of funds for 
      the campaign. They will set up events, parties, benefits, mailing lists 
      and any other forms of public outreach they can to raise money for the 
      campaign.

There are various other positions that Mona will likely need to fill, such as 
assistants to the above three positions, public relations correspondents, and 
social media coordinators.

Together, Mona and her team of bright-minded and dedicated visionaries will 
begin her campaign. Next up on the campaign checklist...

## Set up a campaign bank account ##
It is not necessary for Mona to set up a campaign bank account until she 
registers with the FEC but it may benefit her to set up a separate account 
to later designate as her campaign bank account. This way she can keep track 
of the money she raises and spends while testing the waters. Again, this is 
not necessary, and if Mona was to decide she didn't want to run for office 
after all, she doesn't have to report any of her fundraising and spending as 
long as she remains under the $5000 threshold.

## Registering with the FEC ##
To run for federal office, Mona will have to register with the FEC. She can 
find the appropriate forms at [www.fec.gov][1]. She'll need to file a Statement of 
Candidacy form that authorizes a [Principal Campaign Committee][4] to raise money 
on her behalf. Then, within 10 days of filing her Statement of Candidacy, her 
Principle Campaign Committee must file a Statement of Organization designating 
them as her Principle Campaign Committee. After these forms have been filed her
campaign is ready for the next step! (For local and state elections this 
process may vary. Check with your Secretary of State for further information)

Things for Mona to note:

- She doesn't have to register until she's raised $5000
- Her initial committee doesn't necessarily have to become her registered 
  primary campaign committee.
- Any time a member of her primary campaign committee changes, she must file an 
  updated Statement of Organization.
- Any new organizations or committees that join Mona's campaign will have to 
  file a Statement of Organization.
- All monetary transactions conducted under the campaign must be properly 
  recorded and documented with the FEC.

## Drafting a campaign plan ##
Now that Mona is registered and ready to campaign, she should draft a campaign 
plan. This is a crucial first step towards organizing her campaign. With a 
campaign plan, Mona will outline:

- How many votes she needs to win
    - She'll check the number of registered voters and the expected voter 
      turnout to determine this number
- A general understanding of her constituency and the issues with which they 
  take interest as well as how they've voted in the past
- A plan of action outlining the methodology her committee will use moving 
  forward with the campaign.

A campaign plan will help to set a pragmatic goal for the campaign and will 
provide a reference to check progress during the campaign.  

With Sagebrew's donation system, Mona will be able to set up her [Donation Goals][3] 
and keep better track of her fundraising and campaign activity. This is just 
one way that Sagebrew can assist Mona with her campaign.

## Fundraising ##
While fundraising, Mona and her committee should use all resources available to 
reach as many of her constituents as possible, as well as looking for funding 
elsewhere. This is another area where Sagebrew can play a huge part for Mona. 
With Sagebrew's intuitive communication platform and easy donation system, Mona 
can reach her constituents and encourage them to donate to her campaign with 
little to no effort.

Fundraising is arguably (and unfortunately) the most important aspect of any 
campaign, for these days campaigns are won with money and recognition. The more 
money Mona's campaign can raise, the more actively she can spread her message. 
Luckily for Mona, Sagebrew not only makes it easier to raise money, but 
decreases the amount of money she'll need to spend to get her name and face
out there by making her profile a mere click away for all of her constituents.

## Organization and Scheduling ##
In order for Mona to stay on top of her busy campaigning schedule, she'll want 
to have an assistant or designate another member of her committee to handle her 
schedule. This includes events, meetings, public appearances, and everything 
in-between. An organized campaign is a fluid campaign. Good campaign 
organization can be the difference between success and failure.

## Volunteers ##
Recruiting volunteers to assist with her campaign, Mona is able to cover a 
lot more ground. The more people she can get to assist her the better. 
Volunteers can help run events, mailing, canvasing and much more.

## Public Outreach ##
Mona will have to create a positive public image if her campaign is to be 
successful. While it's important to reach as many people as possible, it's 
usually recommended to target precincts that are neither heavily supportive 
nor heavily opposed to Mona's affiliations. These are the voters that she'll
be most likely to convince to support her.

She will need to host rallies and visit schools and town halls across her 
state. Anything she can do to make her face and ideas known to the public is 
worth looking into.

Again, Sagebrew can play a huge role for Mona here. Utilizing Sagebrew, Mona 
will be able to relay messages to her constituents, update them on her campaign 
progress, and even gauge her popularity among her constituents. There are many 
ways to utilize Sagebrew to engage the public. Remember, votes win elections, 
and recognition wins votes.

If Mona pays attention to all of the details and works hard to stay on top of 
her schedule, she is putting forth her best effort to win the election. No 
election is a guarantee, but by following the guidelines above and staying true 
to her campaign, she can assure that she stands the best possible chance.
