#Do I have to have my name on the ballot to run for federal office?#
Initially, no, you do not have to have your name on the ballot to run for 
federal office. Once you've risen $5000 or once your campaign expenditures
have exceed $5000 you must then register with the FEC to get your name on the 
ballot. See [How do I get my name on the ballot.][1]
