# How do I report suspicious activity by a Representative? #
If you have a valid reason for believing that a representative should be 
reported for suspicious activity, you may flag that representative by going 
to that representative's Action Page and clicking the "flag this
representative" button. This will open a ticket where you'll be able to 
offer a reason for flagging that representative. 

Valid reasons for flagging a representative:

* They have not given a proper update after reaching a Donation Goal
* They have not spent their donation funding as they had promised
* They have been inactive and/or unresponsive for an extended period of time

**DO NOT** flag a representative because you don't agree with their policies or 
beliefs. Flagging representatives is reserved for suspicious or illegal 
activity only, not personal bias.
