# How do I report suspicious activity by a Quest? #
If you have a valid reason for believing that a candidate should be 
reported for suspicious activity, you may flag their Quest by clicking the <i class="fa fa-flag"></i>.
This will open a ticket where you'll be able to offer a reason for flagging 
the candidate. 

Valid reasons for flagging a representative:

* They have not given a proper update after reaching a Donation Goal
* They have not spent their donation funding as they had promised
* They have been inactive and/or unresponsive for an extended period of time

**DO NOT** flag a candidate because you don't agree with their policies or 
beliefs. Flagging candidates is reserved for suspicious or illegal 
activity only, not personal bias.
