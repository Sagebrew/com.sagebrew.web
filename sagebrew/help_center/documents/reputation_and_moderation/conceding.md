# What happens if I concede to another solution? #
When you concede to another Solution your Solution will become grayed out. 

## What this means for you ##

- No more [Commenting][2] on a conceded Solution
- No more [upvoting][3] or [downvoting][4] on a conceded Solution
- No editing allowed on a conceded Solution
- The author of the conceded Solution (you) will retain all [Reputation][1] 
  gained/lost
- 10% of Reputation accrued on the conceded (your) Solution will be awarded 
  to the user of the "better" Solution 

Remember, this process is irreversible. Once you've conceded a Solution to 
another you cannot take that action back. Only concede to a Solution if you 
truly think it is superior to your own.
