# Who are the site moderators, and what is their role here? #
Sagebrew is moderated by a panel of dedicated users called the 
[Admin Council][1]. To join the Admin Council you must be a Sagebrew member,
have achieved at least 10,000 [Reputation][2] and the [Brewmaster][3] rank. 
10,000 Reputation may seem like a steep goal, but we want to ensure that our 
moderators are dedicated and trusted users who will use this privilege 
responsibly. Any ranks beyond Brewmaster, such as the [Tribune][4] Rank 
will retain their moderator status but no additional Admin
privileges will be awarded to any rank higher than Brewmaster. 

The role of the Admin council is to keep Sagebrew running fluidly, and to 
keep Sagebrew a mature and friendly space. The Admin Council's duties include:

- Voting to [Remove Flagged Material][8]
     - The voting system is democratic. A 2/3 majority among participating Admins 
       is required to remove [flagged][9] material. If no flagged material has been 
       voted on after two full days it will be removed. 
- [Closing Conversations][7] 
    - A conversation may become closed if it is voted to be not up to par. 
      Closed Conversations aren't removed, but simply grayed out and closed 
      off to further interaction.
- Closing and Linking [Duplicate][5] Questions 
    - If a Question is found to be a duplicate, it will be closed and a link to 
      the more relevant Conversation will be provided. 
- Place [Protection][6] on Conversations
    - In the case that a Conversation is being unnecessarily flagged or attacked, 
      but it is decided to be a good Conversation, an Admin may place Protection on 
      that conversation so that only members with higher reputation can interact
      with the content.

Think of the Admin Council as the "elders" of the Sagebrew community. They've 
been around and can be trusted to take care of their responsibilities.
