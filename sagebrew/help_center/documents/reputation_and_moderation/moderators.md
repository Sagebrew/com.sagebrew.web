# Who are the site moderators, and what is their role here? #
Sagebrew is moderated by a panel of dedicated users called the 
[Admin Council][1]. To join the Admin Council you must be a Sagebrew member 
and have achieved at least 10,000 [Reputation][2] and the [Brewmaster][3] rank. 
10,000 Reputation may seem like a steep goal, but we want to ensure that our 
moderators are dedicated and trusted users who will use this privilege 
responsibly. Any ranks beyond Brewmaster, such as the [Tribune][4] Rank 
(12,500 reputation) will retain their moderator status but no additional Admin
privileges will be awarded to any rank higher than Brewmaster. 

The role of the Admin council is to keep Sagebrew running fluidly, and to 
keep Sagebrew a mature and friendly space. The Admin Council's duties include:

- Voting to [remove flagged material][8]
    - The voting system is democratic. A 2/3 majority among participating Admins 
      is required to delete flagged material. If no [flagged][9] material has been 
      voted on after two full days it will be deleted. 
- [Closing conversations][7] # TODO
- Removing [duplicate][5] questions # TODO
- Place [Protection][6] on conversations
    - In the case that a conversation is being unnecessarily flagged or attacked, 
      but it is decided to be a good conversation, an Admin may place Protection on 
      that conversation so it may no longer be flagged. 

Think of the Admin Council as the "elders" of the Sagebrew community. They've 
been around and can be trusted to take care of their responsibilities.
