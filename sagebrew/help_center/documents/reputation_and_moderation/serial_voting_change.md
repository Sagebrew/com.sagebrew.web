# Why do I have a Reputation change on my Reputation page that says "serial Upvoting/Downvoting reversed"? #
We've caught someone serial [Upvoting][3] or [Downvoting][4] one or more of 
your contributions. We've penalized the individuals responsible for these 
actions, and we've removed the gained or lost [Reputation][2] from your account. 
We trust you and the greater community, to be honest and meaningful with 
your [Privileges][1], but sadly some people still might abuse them. 
We are sorry for the inconvenience, but Reputation gained or lost as a result of serial 
Up/Downvoting compromises the integrity of the site and detracts from 
meaningful conversation.
