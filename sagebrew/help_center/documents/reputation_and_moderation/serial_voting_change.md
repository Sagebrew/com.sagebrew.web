# Why do I have a Reputation change on my Reputation page that says "serial Upvoting/Downvoting reversed"? #
We've caught someone serial Up/Downvoting one or more of your contributions.
We've penalized the individuals responsible for these actions, and we've removed 
the gained or lost Reputation from your account. We trust you and the greater
community, to be honest and meaningful with your [Privileges][1], but we do 
understand that some people might abuse them. We are sorry for 
the inconvenience, but Reputation gained or lost as a result of serial 
Up/Downvoting compromises the integrity of the site and detracts from 
meaningful conversation.
