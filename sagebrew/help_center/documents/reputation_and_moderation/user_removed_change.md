The only circumstance that would lead to this happening is if another user's 
account was terminated due to an abuse of [Upvoting][1] or [Downvoting][2].

For example: say you posed a Solution to a Question and another user 
Downvoted your Solution. If that user has been caught trolling or 
spamming Downvotes or attempting to manipulate the popularity of a certain 
side of an issue that leads to the termination of their account, we would 
correct any [Reputation][3] you lost as a result of that user's Downvoting. The 
same holds true for Upvotes. If another user Upvotes your Solution and is 
caught manipulating the voting system, any Reputation you gained as a result 
of that user's Upvote will be taken away. 

The primary reason for this is to discourage unfair or manipulative voting. 
We want the conversation here to be honest and truthful, and we want Reputation 
to reflect that honesty and truth.
