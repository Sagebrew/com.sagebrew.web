Voting on Questions, Solutions and [Comments][5] is important because it provides 
helpful feedback and allows the community at large to see which ideas are the 
most popular and the most encompassing. Think of a vote as an indicator that 
you either agree with a Question, Solution, or Comment ([Upvote][1]), or that 
you disagree ([Downvote][2]). Thus, 
voting is Sagebrew's simplest way to show support or opposition and using 
your votes helps other users ensure that the [Conversation][3] is moving 
in the right direction. 

### Two types of votes ###
#### Upvoting ####
Shows support for a Question, Solution, or Comment. Upvote anything 
that you agree with to let that user know that 
you are interested in what they have to say and that you're on the same boat.

##### Requirements & Limitations #####
- 10 [Reputation][4] is required to Upvote
- You're allowed 15 Upvotes per day
- You're allowed 10 additional Upvotes per day on Questions only 
- Upvotes on Comments result in 2 Reputation awarded to the author
- Upvotes on Questions result in 5 Reputation awarded to the author
- Upvotes on Solutions result in 10 Reputation awarded to the author

#### Downvoting ####
Downvoting shows opposition to a Question, Solution, or Comment. Downvote something 
that you strongly disagree with to let the 
author know that you are opposed to their view point. It might be beneficial to 
leave a Comment when Downvoting to explain your position, but it is not 
necessary. 

##### Requirements & Limitations #####

- You will have 15 overall Downvotes per day
- An additional 10 Downvotes will be provided per day for Questions only
- Downvoting Solutions costs you 2 Reputation and removes 10 from the author
