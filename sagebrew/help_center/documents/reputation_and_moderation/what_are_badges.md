# What are badges? #
Sagebrew Badges are pins of honor and recognition. They stand as a testament of 
your active participation and are designed to encourage quality and relevant 
content. In order to obtain one of these badges, you'll have to complete the 
badge requirements. The difficulty of obtaining badges will vary, but each 
badge will require a different level of commitment and dedication to Sagebrew.

Some badges will grow and expand as you do. For example, to obtain the 
"Street Cred" badge you must earn 100 reputation points. Once you've reached 
1000 reputation points your street cred badge updates to the "Well Known" 
badge, and it updates again when you achieve 5000 reputation points to the 
"Infamous" badge. These badges are a way to mark your progress and commitment 
to Sagebrew. 

Obtaining some badges requires real world participation. For example, the 
"Well Read" badge requires you to read books and register them on Sagebrew. 
Sagebrew will track the number of books you've read and your Well Read badge 
will grow and expand the more you read. 

Yet some other badges are hidden, awaiting the discovery of whoever proves 
themselves worthy of attaining them. Good luck unearthing these badges!
