# How do I write a good solution? #
Here at Sagebrew we believe a "good solution" must be well thought out, 
logically sound, [evidence][2] based and insightful. A good solution should provide 
reasonable, achievable goals, and should operate in a realistic fashion 
(i.e. creating a shrink ray and shrinking everyone on the planet is not a 
viable solution to the problem of overpopulation, unless you have an operational
shrink ray). 

Solutions should:

- Take into consideration every aspect of the problem
- Be financially reasonable
- Expose the core of the problem and build from there as opposed to fixing a 
  smaller problem that stems from a larger problem
- Benefit those affected in the greatest possible way

Writing a good solution takes time, dedication, and a lot of thought. 
A good solution doesn't appear overnight. A good solution is the result of 
hard mental labor and iterative revision assisted by feedback from the 
community in the form of [Comments][1] and alternative Solutions.
