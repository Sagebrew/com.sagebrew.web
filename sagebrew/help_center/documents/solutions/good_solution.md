# What should a solution contain? #
Here at Sagebrew we believe a solution to a problem should be 
backed up by [evidence][2]. A solution should provide 
reasonable, achievable goals, and should operate in a realistic fashion 
(i.e. creating a shrink ray and shrinking everyone on the planet is not a 
viable solution to the problem of overpopulation, unless you have an operational
shrink ray). 

Solutions should:

- Take into consideration as many aspect of the problem as possible
- Be financially achievable
- Attempt to solve the root of the problem rather than a symptom
- Benefit those affected in the greatest possible way

A solution is usually the result of
iterative revisions assisted by feedback from the 
community in the form of [Comments][1] and alternative Solutions. So keep an eye 
out for other community members asking for clarification or providing feedback with 
their own view on your solution.
