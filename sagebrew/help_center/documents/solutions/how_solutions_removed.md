#Why and how are some solutions removed?#
Some of the reasons a Solution might be removed are detailed below:
- A Solution was Flagged for containing inappropriate language,
offensive language, or insults of any kind.
- A Solution didn't offer anything relevent to the conversation.
- A Solution was a duplicate of another Solution.

For a Solution to be removed, it must first be flagged
by another user or an Admin. Then, it will be put to a
vote in the Admin Council. A 2/3 majority is required
from participating Admins to remove a Solution.

If you're unhappy with the pending removal of a Solution,
you may appeal to have that decision revoked provided
that the Solution has not already gone through the voting
process. While the Solution is being voted on, you may
open a ticket via a "Appeal Ticket" button on the Solution
and submit a reason you believe the Solution shouldn't
be removed. Think of an appeal as a last effort to
sway the Admin Council's vote. Each Admin will 
read your appeal and consider it during their vote.
