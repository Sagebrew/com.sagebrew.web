Yes you can give a Solution to your own Question! Sometimes, after a 
series of Solutions have been tossed around and debated, you might discover a
Solution you hadn't seen before and would like to add that Solution into the 
mix. However, you will not receive special privileges just because it is your 
Question you are providing a response to. You must still provide a well thought
out and reasonable Solution to the problem. Remember, the goal is to reach the 
best Solution, not just the one you thought of.
