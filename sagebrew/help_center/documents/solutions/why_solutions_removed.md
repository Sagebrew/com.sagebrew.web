# Why and how are some Solutions removed? #
Some of the reasons a Solution might be removed are detailed below:

- A Solution was [Flagged][1] for containing inappropriate language,
  offensive language, or insults of any kind
- A Solution didn't offer anything relevant to the Conversation
- A Solution was a [duplicate][2] of another Solution

For a Solution to be removed, it must first be flagged
by another user. Then, it will be put to a
vote in the [Admin Council][3]. A 2/3 majority is required
from participating Admins to remove a Solution.

{% if debug == True %}
If you're unhappy with the pending or existing removal of a Solution,
you may appeal to have that decision reversed. Think of an appeal as a last effort to
sway the Admin Council's vote. Each Admin will have the opportunity to 
read your appeal and consider it during their vote.
