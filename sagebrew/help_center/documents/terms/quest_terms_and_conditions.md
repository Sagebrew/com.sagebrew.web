# Sagebrew Quest Terms and Conditions #
*The following terms apply specifically to Sagebrew Quest Subscribers*

## General ##
1.  You (the "Quest Subscriber", "Quest Account", "You", or "you") will use 
    the Service to try to achieve the office you pursue.  You will NOT advocate 
    or solicit material outside of your current political campaign agenda or 
    push the agendas of others. 
2.  By registering for a Quest account you agree that you are legally allowed 
    to run for the office you seek as dictated by all local, state, and federal laws. 
3.  You agree to all of the User Terms and Conditions 
    ([http://www.sagebrew.com/help/terms/][5])
4.  By registering for a Quest account you are acknowledging your bid to run 
    for your selected office. By taking your Quest active you are legally 
    "campaigning" for your selected office. By doing so you agree to adhere to 
    all regulations and laws set by the governing body of the region you have 
    selected to campaign in.
5.  If you are a sitting member of public office you may open up a Standard 
    account, but if you would like to verify your identity and maintain a public 
    page you will need to register for a Quest account.
6.  You will not solicit or accept "quid pro quo" interactions that may affect 
    policies or cause illegal activity under the regulations and laws set forth 
    by the governing body of the region you are campaigning in.
7.  You commit to giving a best effort to achieve what you indicate you will be 
    doing through the service. You'll put forth your best effort to fulfill 
    updates and keep your constituents informed as your campaign progresses.
8.  Sagebrew holds the right to suspend moderation of flagged content and access 
    to council interfaces (Administrator Privileges) on a Quest account for any 
    reason. The following are predefined reasons Administrator Privileges shall 
    be taken away: 
    1.  You are the significant other of a sitting elected public official
    2.  You are a cabinet member
    3.  You are a sitting public official
9.  This list is not exhaustive and does not remove Sagebrew's ability to 
    remove administrator privileges of the Quest Subscriber for any reason.
10.	You will not utilize the Service to host illegal content.
11.	You will not exploit the Service or system in any way.



## Contributions and Donation Goals ##
1.  You may collect up to $2,700 in contributions from any individual through the 
    Sagebrew service. You are responsible for refunding and managing any 
    excessive donations that could cause legal ramifications to be taken against 
    your campaign. 
2.  Sagebrew will collect a total of 5% + 30 cents of contributions from Paid
    Quest accounts and 7% + 30 cents of contributions from unpaid Quest accounts.
3.  Sagebrew is not responsible for verifying the identity of any contributors.
4.  Sagebrew is not responsible for verifying the legality of a contribution. 
    Sagebrew shall make information pertaining to all monetary transactions 
    easily accessible to you and your selected Moderators including a Subscriber’s 
    first and last name, address, and donation amount. Sagebrew shall also provide 
    the donator's email for additional follow up. The Quest Subscriber shall 
    not utilize the email address for any purposes outside of gathering 
    additional information about a given donation for legal obligations. Quest 
    Subscribers shall not use Subscriber's emails in email campaigns, for 
    personal contact, or any other reason not explicitly indicated here, unless 
    the Subscriber's email address has been obtained by the Quest Subscriber's 
    campaign outside of the Sagebrew Service.
5.  Sagebrew cannot verify that an individual has not already contributed to 
    the Quest Subscriber on another web service. The responsibility to ensure the 
    legality of funds and contributions falls solely on the Quest Subscriber and 
    their selected Moderators. 
6.  You are responsible for upholding any written Donation Goals that are 
    fulfilled in your Quest.
7.  You will extend your “best effort” to fulfill a Donation Goal. Under the 
    extreme circumstances you cannot complete a Donation Goal, you may do something 
    equivalent to the unattainable Donation Goal and provide an update including an 
    explanation as to why you couldn't complete your intended Donation Goal, and 
    why the replacement will suffice
8.  You shall not utilize any donation information collected from a donating 
    Subscriber to contact the Subscriber in any other way not explicitly outlined
    in these Terms of Service, including but not limited to adding the Subscriber 
    to mailing lists or phone lists. 
 
Payment processing services for Sagebrew LLC on Sagebrew Quest are provided by 
Stripe and are subject to the [Stripe Connected Account Agreement][1], which 
includes the [Stripe Terms of Service][2] (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). 
By agreeing to the Sagebrew Quest Terms and Conditions or continuing to operate as a 
Quest Subscriber on Sagebrew's Quest Platform, you agree to be bound by the
Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to 
time. As a condition of Sagebrew enabling payment-processing services through 
Stripe, you agree to provide Sagebrew accurate and complete information about 
you and your business, and you authorize Sagebrew to share it and transaction 
information related to your use of the payment processing services provided 
by Stripe.


## Donation Reporting ##
Quest Subscribers are responsible for reporting contributions correctly to the 
FEC. Sagebrew will provide the following, if provided by the Subscriber and 
Donator, to the Quest Subscriber specifically for filing to the FEC and for 
no other reason other than what is explicitly stated in this document:

*  First Name
*  Last Name
*  Employer
*  Occupation
*  Address
*  City
*  State
*  Zip code
*  Email Address
*  Phone Number

Filing contributions with the FEC is solely the responsibility of the Quest 
Subscriber. Sagebrew provides no guarantees that the information you receive 
from Sagebrew shall qualify as ready to report. It is up to the Quest 
Subscriber's Committee Treasurer to file the Quest Subscriber's campaign 
reports correctly.

Sagebrew is not held responsible for any legal issues that arise from your use 
of the Service.

For more information on filing with the FEC visit the [FEC website][3].


## Cancellation and Termination ##
1.  Cancellation by the Quest Subscriber may only occur after a set of goals 
    has been completed and prior to the next set starting (Between Rounds). 
    Cancellation requires a phone call to validate the cancellation and an 
    inquiry to assure the proper closing of a Quest account.  Any donations 
    that have not yet been billed will be immediately canceled and removed 
    upon verification of the cancellation request. The Quest Subscriber is 
    responsible for returning any unused funds in compliance with the laws set
    by the governing body of the region they are campaigning in. The Quest 
    Subscriber is responsible for providing an update for the last milestone 
    (Goal) that they set in their Quest page. Sagebrew reserves the right to 
    deny a Cancellation request until the Quest Subscriber has fulfilled such 
    obligations. Cancellation of a Quest Account shall not result in the removal 
    of any content created by the Quest Subscriber or other contributors. 
    Donations and pledge votes shall no longer be allowed to the Quest page 
    after termination.
2.  Sagebrew reserves the right to reduce a Quest Subscriber's [Reputation][4] 
    or suspend and terminate a Quest Subscriber's account if they are known or 
    suspected to have engaged in any unlawful, illegal, irresponsible or malicious 
    activity.
3.  Sagebrew, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate 
    your Quest Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, 
    or any other Sagebrew service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of 
    the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Quest Account 
    or your access to your Quest Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of 
    all Content in your Quest Account. Sagebrew reserves the right to refuse service 
    to anyone for any reason at any time.
