*The following terms apply specifically to Sagebrew Quest Subscribers*

## General ##
1.  You (the "Quest Subscriber", "Quest Account", "You", or "you") will use 
    the Service to try to achieve the office you pursue or the advocacy
    campaign you have outlined.  You will NOT advocate 
    or solicit material outside of the political realm and will not use the 
    service to incorrectly characterize another individual or cause. 
2.  By registering for a Quest account you agree that you are legally allowed 
    to run for the office you seek as dictated by all local, state, and federal laws. 
3.  You agree to all of the User Terms and Conditions 
    ([http://www.sagebrew.com/help/terms/][5])
4.  By registering for a Quest account you are acknowledging your bid to run 
    for your selected office or to advocate for the selected advocacy agenda.
     By taking your Quest active you are legally 
    "campaigning" for your selected office if you start a Public Office based 
    Mission. By doing so you agree to adhere to 
    all regulations and laws set by the governing body of the region you have 
    selected to campaign in.
5.  If you are a sitting member of public office you may open up a Standard 
    account, but if you would like to verify your identity and maintain a public 
    page you will need to register for a Quest account.
6.  You will not solicit or accept "quid pro quo" interactions that may affect 
    policies or cause illegal activity under the regulations and laws set forth 
    by the governing body of the region you are campaigning or advocating in.
7.  You commit to giving a best effort to achieve what you indicate you will be 
    doing through the service. You'll put forth your best effort to fulfill 
    updates and keep your constituents informed as your campaign or advocacy progresses.
8.  Sagebrew holds the right to suspend moderation of flagged content and access 
    to council interfaces (Administrator Privileges) on a Quest account for any 
    reason. The following are predefined reasons Administrator Privileges shall 
    be taken away: 
    1.  You are the significant other of a sitting elected public official
    2.  You are a cabinet member
    3.  You are a sitting public official
9.  This list is not exhaustive and does not remove Sagebrew's ability to 
    remove administrator privileges of the Quest Subscriber for any reason.
10.	You will not utilize the Service to host illegal content.
11.	You will not exploit the Service or system in any way.



## Contributions ##
1.  You are responsible for managing any contribution limits placed on you 
    or your campaign by the governing body that holds legal authority over the area 
    you are campaigning or advocating within. 
2.  Sagebrew will collect a total of 5% + 30 cents of contributions from Paid
    Quest accounts and 7% + 30 cents of contributions from unpaid Quest accounts.
3.  Sagebrew is not responsible for verifying the identity of any contributors.
4.  Sagebrew is not responsible for verifying the legality of a contribution. 
    Sagebrew shall make information pertaining to all monetary transactions 
    easily accessible to you and your selected Moderators including a Subscriber’s 
    first and last name, address, and donation amount. Sagebrew shall also provide 
    the donator's email for additional follow up. The Quest Subscriber shall 
    not utilize the email address for any purposes outside of gathering 
    additional information about a given donation for legal obligations. Quest 
    Subscribers shall not use Subscriber's emails in email campaigns, for 
    personal contact, or any other reason not explicitly indicated here, unless 
    the Subscriber's email address has been obtained by the Quest Subscriber's 
    campaign outside of the Sagebrew Service.
5.  Sagebrew cannot verify that an individual has not already contributed to 
    the Quest Subscriber on another web service. The responsibility to ensure the 
    legality of funds and contributions falls solely on the Quest Subscriber and 
    their selected Moderators.

    that are outlined within your Quest or Missions.
7.  You shall not utilize any donation information collected from a donating 
    Subscriber to contact the Subscriber in any other way not explicitly outlined
    in these Terms of Service, including but not limited to adding the Subscriber 
    to mailing lists or phone lists. 
 
Payment processing services for Sagebrew LLC on Sagebrew Quest are provided by

Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to 
time. As a condition of Sagebrew enabling payment-processing services through

## Donation Reporting ##
Quest Subscribers are responsible for reporting contributions correctly to the 
FEC if their campaign falls within it's jurisdiction. 
Sagebrew will provide the following, if provided by the Subscriber and 
Donator, to the Quest Subscriber specifically for filing to the FEC and for 
no other reason other than what is explicitly stated in this document:

*  First Name
*  Last Name
*  Employer
*  Occupation
*  Address
*  City
*  State
*  Zip code
*  Email Address

Filing contributions with the FEC is solely the responsibility of the Quest 
Subscriber. Sagebrew provides no guarantees that the information you receive 
from Sagebrew shall qualify as ready to report. It is up to the Quest 
Owner to file the Quest Subscriber's campaign 
reports correctly.

of the Service.

## Cancellation and Termination ##
1.  Cancellation by the Quest Subscriber may only occur when there are no 
    pending transactions. To accomplish this the user must first deactivate their 
    Quest prior to deleting it. 
    Any donations 
    that have not yet been billed will be immediately canceled and removed 
    upon verification of the cancellation request. The Quest Subscriber is 
    responsible for returning any unused funds in compliance with the laws set
    by the governing body of the region they are campaigning in. Sagebrew reserves the right to 
    deny a Cancellation request until the Quest Subscriber has fulfilled such 
    obligations. Cancellation of a Quest Account shall not result in the removal 
    of any content created by the Quest Subscriber or other contributors. 
    Donations, votes, endorsements, nor any other form of support 
    shall no longer be allowed to the Quest page 
    after termination.
2.  Sagebrew reserves the right to reduce a Quest Subscriber's [Reputation][4] 
    or suspend and terminate a Quest Subscriber's account if they are known or 
    suspected to have engaged in any unlawful, illegal, irresponsible or malicious 
    activity.
3.  Sagebrew, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate 
    your Quest Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, 
    or any other Sagebrew service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of 
    the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Quest Account 
    or your access to your Quest Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of 
    all Content in your Quest Account. Sagebrew reserves the right to refuse service 
    to anyone for any reason at any time.
