## C. Monetary Matters ##
All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. Free accounts are not

An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you.

For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly 
basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial
months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with 
an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

When changing from a monthly billing cycle to a yearly billing cycle,

Sagebrew will bill for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
{% endif %}

authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, 
levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.

For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level while on a monthly billing cycle, 
the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate 
on your next billing cycle. 

{% if debug == True %}
For upgrades or downgrades while on a yearly plan, 
Sagebrew will immediately charge or refund the difference in plan cost, 
prorated for the remaining time in your yearly billing cycle.
{% endif %}

Switching between a representative account and a standard account may cause 
the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Sagebrew does not 
accept any liability for such loss.

Reducing the subscription of a [Tribune][7] account may cause the loss of Content, 
features, or capacity of your Account. Sagebrew does not accept any liability 
for such loss.

## D. Copyright and Content Ownership ##
We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the 
Service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours. However, by setting 
your pages to be viewed publicly, and/or posting on the Conversation platform
{% if debug == True %}, and/or by creating a Reach Post {% endif %}
you agree to allow others to view your Content.

Your Content shall not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material 
that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless you have 
permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise 
legally entitled to post the material.

Sagebrew does not pre-screen Content, but Sagebrew and its designee have the 
right (but not the obligation) to refuse or remove any Content that is 
available via the Service.

You shall defend Sagebrew against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made 
or brought against Sagebrew by a third-party alleging that Your Content, or 
Your use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, infringes or 
misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third-party or 
violates applicable law, and shall indemnify Sagebrew for any damages 
finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, 
Sagebrew in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding; 
provided, that Sagebrew (a) promptly gives You written notice of the claim, 
demand, suit or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and 
settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that You may 
not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement 
unconditionally releases Sagebrew of all liability); and (c) provides to You 
all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.

The look and feel of the Service is copyright ©2014 Sagebrew LLC. All rights 
reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, 
Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written 
permission from Sagebrew.

## E. Other Websites ##
Sagebrew may contain links to other websites. (For instance, the Conversation,
user profiles, and comments may link to other sites.) When you 
access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We don’t control or 
endorse those sites.

Sagebrew partners with other companies (such as Amazon Payments and Stripe) 
for payment processing. When you donate to a representative or make a transaction,
you’re also agreeing to the payment processor’s terms of service.

## F. Mobile and Other Devices ##
We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that 
your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, 
will still apply.

In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you will 
update your account information on Sagebrew within 48 hours to ensure that your 
messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.

You provide consent and all rights necessary to enable users to sync 
(including through an application) their devices with any information that is 
visible to them on Sagebrew.

## G. Other Legal Responsibilities ##
Sagebrew isn’t liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the 
Services. We don’t become involved in disputes between users, or between users 
and any third party relating to the use of the Services. We don’t oversee the 
performance or punctuality of Donation Goals, and we don’t endorse any content users 
submit to the Site. When you use the Services, you release Sagebrew from 
claims, damages, and demands of every kind — known or unknown, suspected or 
unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed — arising out of or in any way related 
to such disputes and the Services. All content you access through the Services 
is at your own risk. You’re solely responsible for any resulting damage or 
loss to any party.

## H. Cancellation and Termination ##
You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or 
phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can 
cancel your account at any time by clicking on the Settings link in the global 
navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Settings screen provides a simple 
cancellation link.

All of your Content will be stored by the Service upon cancellation for 30 
days. After this 30 day grace period, if You have not reactivated your account 
by following the reactivation link provided in your cancellation email all of 
your private information will be deleted. This information can not be 
recovered after the 30 day grace period.

If You have a paid account and cancel the Service before the end of your 
current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and 
you will not be charged again.

Sagebrew, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your 
account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any 
other Sagebrew service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the 
Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your 
access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content 
in your Account. Sagebrew reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for 
any reason at any time.

## I. Vote Manipulation ##
You agree not to attempt to manipulate voting by any means: manual, mechanical, 
or otherwise. These methods are many and varied, and are included but not 
limited to:

- Asking other users to vote on certain posts, 
  either on Sagebrew itself or anywhere else (through Twitter, 
  Facebook, IM programs, IRC, etc.)
- Being part of a "voting clique" or "vote mob"
- Using shill or multiple accounts, voting services, or any other 
  software to increase votes for submissions

A "voting clique" is a group of people who send links to their submissions 
via message, IM, or any other means, with the expectation 
of "you guys vote for my stuff and I'll vote for yours." 

A "vote mob" is a group of people who agree to vote on certain things together, 
either a specific submission, a user, a domain, or anything like that. 

You agree to follow the guidelines specified in the [Upvote][5] and 
[Downvote][6] privilege articles.

Cheating or attempting to manipulate voting will result in your 
account being suspended pending termination. 

## J. General ##
Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The service is provided on an 
"as is" and "as available" basis.

Support for Sagebrew services is only available in English, via email.

You understand that Sagebrew uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to 
provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related 
technology required to run the Service.

You must not modify, adapt or hack the Service or modify another website so as 
to falsely imply that it is associated with the Service, Sagebrew, or any other 
Sagebrew service.

You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any
portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without 
the express written permission by Sagebrew.

We may, but have no obligation to, hide Content and Accounts containing 
Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, 
threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise 
objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of 
Service. We reserve the right to remove content that is illegal in nature (such 
as child pornography) at our sole discretion and without notice at any time. 

Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or 
retribution) of any Sagebrew customer, employee, member, or officer will 
result in immediate account suspension. Further investigation may result in 
termination of the account. 

You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, 
including your Content, may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) 
transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt 
to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

You must not upload, post, host, or transmit unsolicited email, SMSs, or 
"spam" messages.

You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.

If your bandwidth usage significantly exceeds the average bandwidth usage 
(as determined solely by Sagebrew) of other Sagebrew customers, we reserve 
the right to immediately disable your account or throttle your usage until 
you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

Sagebrew does not warrant that (i) the service will meet your specific 
requirements, (ii) the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or 
error-free, (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the 
service will be accurate or reliable, (iv) the quality of any products, 
services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through 
the service will meet your expectations, and (v) any errors in the Service 
will be corrected.

You expressly understand and agree that Sagebrew shall not be liable for any 
direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, 
including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data 
or other intangible losses (even if Sagebrew has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability 
to use the service; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and 
services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or 
obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the 
service; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or 
data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third-party on the service; (v) or any 
other matter relating to the service.

Based on current legal regulations Sagebrew discourages felons from 
pledging to vote for a representative (as you are legally not permitted to 
vote in any election and your pledge would be an empty one). Sagebrew does not 
agree with this facet of the law, but alas we feel obligated to iterate it. 

You must be a United States Citizen to register for an account. 

The failure of Sagebrew to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the 
Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. 
The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and Sagebrew 
and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between 
you and Sagebrew (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the 
Terms of Service). You agree that these Terms of Service and Your use of the 
Service are governed under Michigan law.

Questions about the Terms of Service should be sent to [support@sagebrew.com][3]

If you are a government user or otherwise accessing or using any Sagebrew 
service in a government capacity, this Amendment to Sagebrew Terms of 
Service shall apply to you.


## Amendment I ##
### Representative Account Terms ###
*The following terms apply specifically to Representative accounts*
{% if debug == True %}
Adding Aides to manage their page (legal responsibility will still fall on 
the rep)
{% endif %}

Cancellation will require a phone call validation and short inquiry to assure 
the proper closing of a rep account

You are responsible for upholding any written Donation Goals that are fulfilled
on your Action Page.

by signing up for a rep account you are planning on actually running (don't 
just sign up and not run)

If you are a sitting member of public office you may not sign up for a 
standard account 
{% comment %}
we might want to change our stance on this since we now
distinguish the Action Page almost completely from the user's private profile. 
But we'd still greatly encourage this as the Action Page of a sitting 
representative will lack in fullness and not enable users to easy interact with them.
{% endcomment %}

We hold the right to suspend administrator privileges based on the following 
circumstances:

- You are the significant other of an elected public official
- You are a cabinet member
- If you are a public official

Sagebrew reserves the right to reduce a representatives [Reputation][1] or 
suspend a representative's account if they are publicly known to have engaged 
in any unlawful, illegal, irresponsible or malicious activity on the Sagebrew 
site or in real life.

As a freshman/sophomore rep you may keep all accumulated reach posts from 
those you've gained through achieving [Tribune][7] status. This privilege is 
suspended after your sophomore year term
