    that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and 
    data charges, will still apply.

## Vote Manipulation ##
You agree not to attempt to manipulate voting by any means: manual, mechanical, 
or otherwise. These methods are many and varied, and are included but not

1.	Don't ask other users to vote on certain posts, either on Sagebrew itself 
    or anywhere else (through Twitter, Facebook, IM programs, IRC, etc.)
2.	Don't be part of a "voting clique" or "vote mob"

        A voting clique is a group of people who send links to their submissions around 
        via message, IM, or any other means, with the expectation of "you guys vote for 
        my stuff and I'll vote for yours." A "vote mob" is a group of people who agree 
        to vote on certain things together; either a specific submission, a user, a
        domain, or anything like that. Upvote each submission or content for the value 
        of the information in it, a variety of things that you think are interesting 
        and will benefit the community.

3.	Don't use shill or multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software 
    to increase votes for submission.
4.	Cheating or attempting to manipulate voting will result in your account 
    being suspended pending termination. 



## Miscellaneous ##
This Agreement, as modified from time to time, constitutes the entire agreement 
between You and Sagebrew with respect to the subject matter hereof. This 
Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, 
written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof. The failure of either 
party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be 
deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Sagebrew shall not be liable 
for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results 
from any cause beyond Sagebrew’s reasonable control, including, without 
limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. 
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, 
that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary 
so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and 
enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by 
Subscriber except with Sagebrew’s prior written consent. Sagebrew may assign 
this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without Subscriber’s consent. 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws 
of the state of Michigan without regard to the conflict of laws provisions 
thereof. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a 
result of this Agreement and Subscriber does not have any authority of any kind 
to bind Sagebrew in any respect whatsoever. Any notice to the Service that is 
required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed 
effective upon receipt, when sent by confirmed e-mail to [support@sagebrew.com][3].
