<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You’re now a Brewmaster, one of our most trusted members! 
With this awesome title comes a great responsibility. You now have the ability 
to step behind the scenes at Sagebrew and join the ranks of the Admins by 
joining the <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a>. We’re relying on you to guide the Sagebrew 
community and to lead through example.</p>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now access the Admin Panel</li>
<li>You’ll be able to review <a href="/help/privileges/flagging/">Flagged</a> Questions, Solutions, and Comments, 
  determining whether or not they merit deletion, closure, or are harmless. 
  The Admin Council works a little like a democracy. All Flagged posts are 
  brought to the Admin Panel where they can vote on them. A 2/3 majority 
  among Admins who vote on Flagged posts is required before a Flagged piece of content is 
  <a href="/help/conversation/deletions/">Deleted</a> or <a href="/help/conversation/closed/">Closed</a>.</li>
<li>Close <a href="/help/questions/duplicates/">Duplicates</a></li>
<li>Ability to <a href="/help/conversation/protected/">Protect</a> a Conversation</li>
<li>Certify newly added positions that Missions can run for</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Admin and up privileges are suspended if you open a Quest account or are 
elected to office. Also if you are a spouse of an elected official your 
moderator privileges shall be suspended for the length of their service to 
their country.</p>
