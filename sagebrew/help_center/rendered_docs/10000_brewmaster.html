<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You’re now a Brewmaster, one of our most trusted members! 
With this awesome title comes a great responsibility. You now have the ability 
to step behind the scenes at Sagebrew and join the ranks of the Admins by 
joining the <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a>. We’re relying on you to guide the Sagebrew 
community and to lead through example.</p>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now access the Admin Panel</li>
<li>You’ll be able to review <a href="/help/privileges/flagging/">Flagged</a> Questions, Solutions, and Comments, 
  determining whether or not they merit deletion, closure, or are harmless. 
  The Admin Council works a little like a democracy. All Flagged posts are 
  brought to the Admin Panel where they can vote on them. A 2/3 majority 
  among Admins who vote on Flagged posts is required before a Flagged post be 
  <a href="/help/questions/why_are_questions_deleted/">deleted</a> or <a href="/help/questions/closure_of_a_question/">closed</a>. If a Flagged post is left untouched for two days 
  it will automatically be deleted or closed.</li>
<li>Close <a href="/help/questions/duplicate_question/">duplicate</a> Questions</li>
<li>You may now create 3 <a href="TBD">Reach Posts</a> per week. A Reach Post is a post 
  that gets shared with your entire city. Use these wisely. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Admin and up privileges suspended if you open a representative account or are 
elected to office. Also if you are a spouse of an elected official your 
moderator privileges shall be suspended for the length of their service to
