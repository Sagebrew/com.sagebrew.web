important topics that you'd like to see conversation surround. Upvote Solutions
you believe are the best out of those provided. The more Upvotes a
conversation gets, the more traffic that conversation will get.</p>
<h3>What should I use Upvoting for?</h3>
<p>Upvoting is our way of enabling you to express your agreement or interest on a 
given contribution. If you find a Solution to be particularly helpful give it an Upvote 
and help raise awareness of that solution. If you think a particular Question 
merits more traffic, give it an Upvote to help it on its way. If you believe a 
Comment should be used to improve a Solution or Question give it an Upvote.</p>
<h3>What happens when I Upvote?</h3>
<p>When you Upvote a Question or Solution the author of that content receives additional 
reputation. The author will also receive a notification that someone upvoted thier 
content but they will not be able to see who it was that did so.</p>
<h3>Can people see my Upvotes?</h3>

viewable by your friends but only your friends any no one else.</p>
