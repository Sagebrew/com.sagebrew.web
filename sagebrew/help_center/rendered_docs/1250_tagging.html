<h2>Description</h2>
<p>You now have the ability to create your own Tags! This will allow you to more 
accurately Tag your content and potentially drive traffic to your Conversations
with custom Tags that better fit your material. This is an exciting feature and one 
that should not be taken lightly. The rules are pretty 
simple folks: no inappropriate Tags, no offensive Tags...basically if you would 
have laughed at it when you were twelve, you probably shouldn't make it a Tag.</p>
<h2>When should I create a Tag?</h2>
<p>You should create a Tag when it further clarifies what the Conversation should
be about, or if there is a word or phrase that better describes the material 
within it. For example, if the Question of whether or not police 
officers should wear cameras arises and you want to cite the city of Ferguson, 
Missouri and the events that transpired there, you could create the 
Tag <code>Ferguson</code> to give the Question further relevance during a search. 
In this way, you are simply making it easier for members interested in 
Ferguson to find and participate in the conversation. </p>
<h2>When shouldn't I create a Tag?</h2>
<p>You should refrain from creating Tags that are offensive, inappropriate, 
obscene, libelous, irrelevant, or spam. </p>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>You can place 5 tags on any Question. </p>
<h3>Remember</h3>
<p>Your tags determine the <a href="/help/reputation/">Reputation</a> breakdown for a Conversation. If you spark 
a Question and tag it with "science" and "foreign Policy" all the reputation 
you gain as a result of conversation on that Question will be split evenly 
between the Science and Foreign Policy Reputation categories. </p>
<h4>For example:</h4>
<p>Sir Percival sparks a Question that he tags with "Social" and "Economic." The 
Question generates Sir Percival 400 reputation. 200 Reputation is allocated to 
the "Social" Reputation spec. The other 200 is allocated to the "Economic" 
Reputation spec. </p>
<p>These allocations designate specialty within a certain subject. If Sir 
Percival has gained a large amount of Reputation within the "Social" spec, 
it can be surmised that he is a credible source within social topics. </p>
