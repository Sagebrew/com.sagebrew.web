<li>Create Posts on own wall and friend’s walls</li>
<li>Ability to Create Questions and Solutions</li>
<li>Ability to Edit Own Questions</li>
<li>Ability to Concede to more viable Solutions</li>

</ul>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is the most basic privilege: the ability to communicate with others.</p>
<p>You can reach out to your friends and start Private Conversations. Consider 
Private Conversations a testing ground where you can discuss issues with your 
friends and family without worrying about Reputation. This is a place to 
practice proper discussion etiquette, or to blow off etiquette altogether if 
you’d like. It’s your space. Have fun.</p>
<p>You can also create Questions and provide Solutions in the public Conversation 
Area. This is your opportunity to lend your voice to the ongoing discussions, 
allowing you to interact with other like-minded visionaries and find solutions 
to real problems. Note that Reputation is on the line in the Conversation Area. 
You may amass Reputation for quality Questions and Solutions, or you may lose 
Reputation for poor quality Questions and Solutions. </p>
<p>Lastly, you'll be able to Concede your Solutions to more viable/invested 
Solutions if you desire. If somebody comes up with a Solution that seems to 
cover more ground than yours, there is no shame in Conceding to that person's 
solution! In fact, by Conceding to a better solution, you've shown that you're 
here to find the best answer to a problem and not to argue a moot point! </p>
<p>Time to stir the brew!  </p>
<h2>Conversation Etiquette</h2>
<h4>When should I ask Questions?</h4>
<p>You should ask a Question when you have thoroughly examined an issue that 
you believe to be a problem and would like assistance exploring potential 
solutions to that problem. </p>
<h3>What's a good Question look like?</h3>
<p>A good Question is a Question that has no clear answer and involves multiple 
points of view. A good Question should be backed up with facts drawn from 
reliable sources. </p>
<h4>Example of a Good Question</h4>
<h5>How can we reduce the amount of NO2 pollution in the atmosphere?</h5>
<hr />
<p>NO2 is a greenhouse gas 300 times more harmful to the environment than CO2, 
and the levels of NO2 in the environment are rising far above average 
atmospheric fluctuation. Large scale agriculture is a main culprit, as 
Nitrogen rich fertilizers are spreading too much nitrogen into the fields, 
causing microbes in the soil to break release that extra nitrogen into the 
atmosphere. What can farmers do to reduce the amount of NO2 being placed into 
the atmosphere? </p>

<h3>What's a bad Question look like?</h3>
<p>A Question is a bad Question if it is: offensive, only has one side, 
has an obvious answer, is not aimed at finding a solution, does not make 
sense etc. If you aren't sure if your Question is good or bad, start a 
Private Conversation first and see what kind of feedback you get. If it 
seems to spark a good conversation with multiple sides, it's probably okay. 
If it doesn't, well, take it back to the drawing board and rework it. </p>
<h4>Example of a Bad Question</h4>
<h5>Why do republicans keep wasting their time fighting Obamacare?</h5>
<hr />
<p>Note how there is no context, no information provided other than the Question, 
and the Question is posed as a one-sided question. To make this a good Question,
a more in-depth look at the Affordable Care Act and the politics behind it is 
needed, as well as fact-based context to provide further insight. </p>
<h3>When should I provide a Solution?</h3>
<p>You should provide a Solution if you have anything relevant to add to the 
conversation. If there is an angle or a thought that has not been presented 
yet, and you can lend merit to that thought, create a Solution. Don't 
provide a Solution that has already been provided, and don't provide a 
Solution that doesn't add new information to the conversation. </p>
<h3>What happens to my Question?</h3>
<p>Your Question, like a shooting star in the night sky, might burn brightly for 
a short time, igniting a conversation between visionaries until a solution is 
reached and it fizzles out and is replaced by others. Or, like a mountain, 
your Question may continue to gain attention as new, relevant 
information comes to light, and might remain a contesting Question for a 
long time. Regardless, all Questions are archived and you'll be able to review 
them at any time you'd like. If your Question was part of a 
Private Conversation it will remain archived on your page for you 
and your friends to see should they so choose. </p>
<h3>When should I Concede to another Solution?</h3>
<p>You should Concede to another Solution if you honestly think somebody has 
come up with a better Solution. </p>
<h3>What happens to my Solution if I Concede to another?</h3>
<p>Your Solution will be grayed out. What this means for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more commenting on a Conceded Solution</li>
<li>No more Up/Downvoting on a Conceded Solution</li>
<li>No editing allowed on a Conceded Solution</li>
<li>The author of the Conceded Solution will retain all Reputation gained/lost
  10% of Reputation accrued on the Conceded Solution will be awarded 
  to the user of the "better" Solution </li>
<li>The process of Conceding a Solution is irreversible</li>
</ul>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>There are many different types of research studies conducted with the aim of 
shedding light on a certain causation. The most popular research studies are 
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case Studies</li>
<li>Case Control Studies</li>
<li>Cohort Studies</li>
<li>Controlled Clinical Trials</li>
<li>Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials</li>
<li>Systematic Reviews</li>
<li>Meta-analysis </li>
<li>Anecdotal Evidence</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about these different kinds of research and how/where/when to 
utilize them visit the <a href="insert_link_here">Research Area</a>.</p>
<h2>Question Restrictions</h2>
<p>After a Solution has been provided to a Question, you will no longer be able 
to edit or change the Question itself. This ensures that everyone stays on the 
same page and that we don't get wildly off topic. If you feel that you'd like 
to change a Question after certain information has come to light, you may 
change the context of the Question, but not the Question itself. In the 
case that the Solutions have gotten so far off topic from the original Question
and updating context simply won't do the Question justice, it's best to simply
start a new Question. </p>
<p>You will be limited to associating 5 tags with a given question. </p>
<h2>1 Up!</h2>
<p>All new users will recieve 1 Free Upvote! Use carefully! </p>
