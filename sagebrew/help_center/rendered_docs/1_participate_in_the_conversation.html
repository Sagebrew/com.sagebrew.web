<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This is the most basic privilege: the ability to communicate with others.</p>
<p>You can create Questions and provide Solutions in the Conversation Cloud. This is 
your opportunity to lend your voice to the ongoing discussions, 
allowing you to interact with other like-minded visionaries and find solutions 
to real problems. Note that Reputation is on the line in the 
Conversation Cloud. You may amass Reputation for quality Questions and 
Solutions, or you may lose Reputation for poor quality Questions and Solutions. </p>
<p>Time to stir the brew!  </p>
<h3>Conversation Etiquette</h3>
<h4>When should I ask Questions?</h4>
<p>You should ask a Question when you have thoroughly examined an issue that 
you believe to be a problem and would like assistance exploring potential 
solutions to that problem. </p>
<h4>What's a good Question look like?</h4>
<p>A good Question is a Question that has no clear solution and involves multiple 
points of view. A good Question should be backed up with facts drawn from 
reliable sources. </p>
<h4>What's a bad Question look like?</h4>
<p>A Question is a bad Question if it is: offensive, only has one side, 
has an obvious solution, is not aimed at finding a solution, does not make 
sense etc. </p>
<h4>When should I provide a Solution?</h4>
<p>You should provide a Solution if you have anything relevant to add to the 
conversation. If there is an angle or a thought that has not been presented 
yet, and you can lend merit to that thought, create a Solution. </p>
<p>Don't provide a Solution that has already been provided or a 
Solution that doesn't add new information to the conversation. </p>
<h4>What happens to my Question?</h4>
<p>Your Question, like a shooting star in the night sky, might burn brightly for 
a short time, igniting a conversation between visionaries until a solution is 
reached and it fizzles out and is replaced by others. Or, like a mountain, 
your Question may continue to gain attention as new, relevant 
information comes to light, and might remain a contesting Question for a 
long time. Regardless, all Questions are archived and you'll be able to review 
them at any time you'd like. </p>
<h4>Question Linking</h4>
<p>If you have a question about a specific detail in another Question, it may be 
best to pose an entirely new Question. In this case, it would be beneficial 
both to you and to the author of the original Question if you provided a link 
in your context to the other authors Question. For example:</p>
<p>Somebody asks the Question </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How can we reform the institution of higher learning in the U.S.?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem of student debt is raised, but you think it's an entirely new 
Question waiting to happen. You decide to ask the Question </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How can we reduce the enormous amount of accrued student debt in the U.S.?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of your question, you provide a link to the original 
Question (How can we reform the institution of higher learning in the U.S.?)
and by linking to that Question you're acknowledging that that Question exists, 
is worth looking into, and relates to your Question. </p>
<p>Question linking can be a great way to reach a broader audience and support other authors' Questions by diving deeper.  </p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>There are many different types of <a href="/help/conversation/research/">research studies</a> conducted with the aim of 
shedding light on a certain causation. The most popular research studies are 
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case Studies</li>
<li>Case Control Studies</li>
<li>Cohort Studies</li>
<li>Controlled Clinical Trials</li>
<li>Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials</li>
<li>Systematic Reviews</li>
<li>Meta-analysis </li>
<li>Anecdotal Evidence</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question Restrictions</h3>
<p>After a Solution has been provided to a Question, you will no longer be able 
to edit or change the Question itself. This ensures that everyone stays on the 
same page and that we don't get wildly off topic. If you feel that you'd like 
to change a Question after certain information has come to light, you may 
change the context of the Question, but not the Question itself. In the 
case that the Solutions have gotten so far off topic from the original Question
and updating context simply won't do the Question justice, it's best to simply
start a new Question. </p>
<p>You will be limited to associating 5 tags with a given question. </p>
