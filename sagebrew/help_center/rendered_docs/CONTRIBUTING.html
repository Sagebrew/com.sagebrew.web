<h2>Bugs Reports</h2>
<p>A bug is a <em>demonstrable problem</em> that is caused by the code in the
repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful – thank you!</p>
<p>Guidelines for bug reports:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the GitHub issue search</strong> &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed</strong> &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest <code>master</code> or integration branch in the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolate the problem</strong> &mdash; ideally create a reduced test
   case and a live example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific
   information about the environment – operating system and version, browser
   and version, version of typeahead.js – and steps required to reproduce the 
  issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Feature Requests &amp; Contribution Enquiries</h2>
<p>Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to <em>you</em> to make a strong
case for the inclusion of your feature. Please provide as much detail and
context as possible.</p>
<p>Contribution enquiries should take place before any significant pull request,
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that we might
have good reasons for rejecting.</p>
<h2>Pull Requests</h2>
<p>Good pull requests – patches, improvements, new features – are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.</p>
<p>Make sure to adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the codebase
(indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test
coverage).</p>
<p>Please follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the
project:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/typeahead.js
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd &lt;repo-name&gt;
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream git://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js</code></p>
<ol>
<li>If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Install the dependencies (you must have Node.js and <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a>
   installed), and create a new topic branch (off the main project development
   branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   npm install
   bower install
   git checkout -b &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;</code></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run <code>npm test</code> to check that
   all tests pass after you've made changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit your changes in logical chunks. Provide clear and explanatory commit
   messages. Use Git's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase">interactive rebase</a> feature to tidy up
   your commits before making them public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Push your topic branch up to your fork:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   git push origin &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;</code></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Open a Pull Request</a>
    with a clear title and description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are asked to amend your changes before they can be merged in, please
   use <code>git commit --amend</code> (or rebasing for multi-commit Pull Requests) and
   force push to your remote feature branch. You may also be asked to squash
   commits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
