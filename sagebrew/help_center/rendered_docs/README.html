<h3>Cross-domain requirements</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Cross-domain-uploads">Cross-domain File Uploads</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js">Iframe Transport plugin</a> require a redirect back to the origin server to retrieve the upload results. The <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/main.js">example implementation</a> makes use of <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/cors/result.html">result.html</a> as a static redirect page for the origin server.</p>
<p>The repository also includes the <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/cors/jquery.xdr-transport.js">jQuery XDomainRequest Transport plugin</a>, which enables limited cross-domain AJAX requests in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE 10 supports cross-domain XHR requests).<br />
The XDomainRequest object allows GET and POST requests only and doesn't support file uploads. It is used on the <a href="https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/">Demo</a> to delete uploaded files from the cross-domain demo file upload service.</p>
