<h1>What happens when I donate to a Candidate?</h1>
<p>After you've indicated you'd like to donate to a candidate you will receive an email 
stating that you will donate "x" amount of money to candidate "y" upon them 
reaching their <a href="/help/citizens/donation_goals/">Donation Goal</a>. 
You will not be charged and your donation will not be provided to the candidate 
until their Donation Goal has been reached, at which time you will receive a 
second email with a notification that confirms your donation. The 
representative you donated to will also receive notice that you have donated 
to their cause. In the instance that a candidate does 
not reach their Donation Goal, you will not be charged.</p>
