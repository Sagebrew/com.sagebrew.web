<h1>What happens when I donate to a Quest?</h1>
<p>After you've indicated you'd like to donate to a Quest you will receive an email 
stating that you will donate the amount you specified to the candidate you selected 
upon them reaching their <a href="/help/donating/donation_goals/">Donation Goal</a>. </p>
<p>You will not be charged and your donation will not be provided to the Quest 
until their Donation Goal has been reached. When the goal is reached you will be
billed and you will receive a second email with a notification that confirms your 
donation. The candidate you donated to will also receive notice that you 
have donated to their Quest.</p>
<p>In the instance that a candidate does not reach their Donation Goal, you will 
not be charged.</p>
