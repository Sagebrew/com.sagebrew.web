<h1>Be Nice</h1>
<p>This is just a friendly reminder to be nice when conversing. Nobody 
likes feeling alienated or put down. Sagebrew is a site for people 
to work together and do some truly remarkable things, so lets keep it 
courteous! There are many conversational behaviors that are frowned upon 
at Sagebrew and might get you flagged for inappropriate conduct. Some general 
guidelines:</p>
<h2>Do not use language that is:</h2>
<ul>
<li>offensive (i.e. racist, sexist, ableist, classist, 
   anti-religious...basically anything that takes aim at a marginalized group 
   of people)</li>
<li>libelous (lying)</li>
<li>obscene (profanity)</li>
<li>insulting (anything that directly targets an individual, making little of 
   their opinion or position)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be respectful of other's ideas</h2>
<p>This means respecting someone's position even if it is in direct opposition to y
our own. As Aristotle said so long ago, "It is the mark of an educated mind 
to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." </p>
<p>Just because someone thinks something should be done differently doesn't
mean that they are wrong or that their idea is less worthy of consideration. 
Take the time to really consider each side of a Conversation. Often the best 
Solutions include ideas from all sides, and if you aren't respectful of other 
sides, you're likely to miss out on the best Solution. </p>
<h2>No Trolling</h2>
<p>Don't play devil's advocate for the sole purpose of stirring up chaos. You 
aren't assisting in finding a solution and you aren't helping anybody. </p>
<h2>Do not argue for argument's sake</h2>
<p>The purpose of a Conversation is to find a common Solution that best 
accommodates the needs of all. The purpose of a Conversation is not to argue 
your point stubbornly, but to genuinely wish to fix a problem. </p>
<p>It's simple folks! In the wise words of Aretha Franklin: R E S P E C T. </p>
