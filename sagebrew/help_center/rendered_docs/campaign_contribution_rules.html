<h1>Campaign Contributions</h1>
<p>There are rules and regulations in place when it comes to donating money to a 
political campaign. These rules and regulations are set in an effort to keep 
campaigning fair and to place a barrier between money and political sway.
By donating to a candidate on Sagebrew you are committing to follow the
listed regulations as well as any not indicated here but enforced by the 
<a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/contrib.shtml#Chart">Federal Election Commission (FEC)</a>.
The  basic contribution limits are as follows:</p>
<h2>Individuals</h2>
<ul>
<li>May contribute $2700 to any candidate or candidate committee per election 
  (the primary and general are separate elections).</li>
<li>May contribute up to $33,400 to a national party committee per calendar year.</li>
<li>May contribute a combined $10,000 to local, district, and state party 
  committees per calendar year.</li>
<li>May contribute an additional $5,000 per calendar year to any other 
  political committee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PACs</h2>
<h3>What is a PAC?</h3>
<p>PAC is short for Political Action Committee. A PAC is an organization usually 
formed with the intent of raising money to elect certain candidates and defeat 
others. PACs usually represent business, labor, or ideological interests.
We currently only enable individuals to donate to campaigns who have setup
an <a href="/advocacy/">Advocacy</a> or <a href="/political/">Political</a> Mission.</p>
<h3>Who can form a PAC?</h3>
<p>Anyone! The process for registering is fairly simple and is detailed on 
the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/ans/answers_pac.shtml#connected">FEC's</a> website.</p>
<h3>Multicandidate vs Single Candidate PACs</h3>
<p>Multicandidate PACs are PACs that have been registered with the Federal 
Election Commission as a political committee for at least six months, have 
received contributions from more than 50 people, and have contributed to at 
least five federal candidates.</p>
<h3>How much can they contribute?</h3>

<h2>Super PAC</h2>
<p>A Super PAC is a new class of PAC that arose in 2010 as a result of a Supreme 
Court case called SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission. A Super PAC 
is a PAC that may raise unlimited amounts of funding from corporations, unions, 
associations and individuals, and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate 
for or against candidates through advertising. Super PACs must report their 
fundraising and expenditures to the FEC.</p>
