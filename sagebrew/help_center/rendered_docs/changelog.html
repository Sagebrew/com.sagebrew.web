<h3>0.11.0 April 25, 2015</h3>
<p>An overhaul of typeahead.js – consider this a release candidate for v1. There
are bunch of API changes with this release so don't expect backwards 
compatibility with previous versions. There are also many new undocumented 
features that have been introduced. Documentation for those features will be 
added before v1 ships.</p>
<p>Beware that since this release is pretty much a rewrite, there are bound to be
some bugs. To be safe, you should consider this release beta software and 
throughly test your integration of it before using it in production 
environments. This caveat only applies to this release as subsequent releases
will address any issues that come up.</p>

<h3>0.10.0 February 2, 2014</h3>
<p><strong>Introducting Bloodhound</strong></p>
<p>This release was almost a complete rewrite of typeahead.js and will hopefully
lay the foundation for the 1.0.0 release. It's impossible to enumerate all of 
the issues that were fixed. If you want to get an idea of what issues 0.10.0 
resolved, take a look at the closed issues in the <a href="https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/issues?milestone=8&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">0.10.0 milestone</a>.</p>
<p>The most important change in 0.10.0 is that typeahead.js was broken up into 2 
individual components: Bloodhound and jQuery#typeahead. Bloodhound is an 
feature-rich suggestion engine. jQuery#typeahead is a jQuery plugin that turns
input controls into typeaheads.</p>
<p>It's impossible to write a typeahead library that supports every use-case out 
of the box – that was the main motivation behind decomposing typeahead.js. 
Previously, some prospective typeahead.js users were unable to use the library 
because either the suggestion engine or the typeahead UI did not meet their
requirements. In those cases, they were either forced to fork typeahead.js and
make the necessary modifications or they had to give up on using typeahead.js
entirely. Now they have the option of swapping out the component that doesn't 
work for them with a custom implementation.</p>
