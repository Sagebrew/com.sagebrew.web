<p>When something is closed it means that no further interaction (no more 
Comments, Solutions, Upvotes, or Downvotes) can be had with the content.
This occurs when the Community <a href="/help/privileges/flagging/">flags</a> something as lacking in depth or believes 
something is a <a href="/help/questions/duplicates/">duplicate</a> and the <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a> votes in two-thirds 
agreement with the flags.</p>
<p>These pieces of content aren't <a href="/help/conversation/deletions/">deleted</a>, but instead are kept around
so they may stand as examples of contributions that either need improvement or
to point the way to the original Conversation.</p>
