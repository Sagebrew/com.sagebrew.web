<h1>What happens if I concede to another solution?</h1>
<p>When you concede to another solution your solution will become grayed out. 
What this means for you:
- No more commenting on a conceded solution
- No more up/downvoting on a conceded solution
- No editing allowed on a conceded solution
- The author of the conceded solution (you) will retain all reputation 
  gained/lost
- 10% of reputation accrued on the conceded (your) solution will be awarded 
  to the user of the "better" solution </p>
<p>Remember, this process is irreversible. Once you've conceded a solution to 
another you cannot take that action back. Only concede to a solution if you 
truly think it superior to your own. </p>
