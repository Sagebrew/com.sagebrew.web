<h1>What happens if I concede to another solution?</h1>
<p>When you concede to another Solution your Solution will become grayed out. </p>
<h2>What this means for you</h2>
<ul>
<li>No more <a href="/help/privileges/comment/">Commenting</a> on a conceded Solution</li>
<li>No more <a href="/help/privileges/upvote/">upvoting</a> or <a href="/help/privileges/downvote/">downvoting</a> on a conceded Solution</li>
<li>No editing allowed on a conceded Solution</li>
<li>The author of the conceded Solution (you) will retain all <a href="/help/reputation/">Reputation</a> 
  gained/lost</li>
<li>10% of Reputation accrued on the conceded (your) Solution will be awarded 
  to the user of the "better" Solution </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, this process is irreversible. Once you've conceded a Solution to 
another you cannot take that action back. Only concede to a Solution if you 
truly think it is superior to your own. </p>
