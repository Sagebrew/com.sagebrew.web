<p>In order for a contribution to be <a href="/help/conversation/deletions/">removed</a> due to "<a href="/help/policies/do_not_spam/">spam</a>" a couple things must 
happen. Another user must <a href="/help/privileges/flagging/">Flag</a> your contribution as spam. The <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin 
Council</a> must then vote on the Flag and decide that, yes, it is spam. A 2/3 
majority among participating Admins is required to remove a contribution.</p>
<p>If multiple pieces of content are labeled as spam in this way, your 
account will be suspended from adding additional contributions to the 
Conversation Cloud.</p>
