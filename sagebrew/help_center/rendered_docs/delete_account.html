<h1>How do I delete my account?</h1>
<p>While we are very sad that you've even considered the possibility of deleting 
your account and abandoning the Sagebrew community, we guess you reserve that 
right....</p>
<p>All you have to do to delete your account is to go to your profile, click 
on your account settings tab, navigate to the "delete my account" option 
at the bottom and follow the instructions provided. You will receive an email 
confirmation that your account has been deleted. After you've deleted your 
account, we will keep the records of your friends, conversations, 
site preferences, privileges, reputation, and badges for 30 days. If you 
decide to reinstate your account within this 30 day grace period you will 
regain full access to your account as it was prior to deletion. After the 
30 day grace period your information will be deleted and you will not be able 
to reinstate your account as it was. </p>
