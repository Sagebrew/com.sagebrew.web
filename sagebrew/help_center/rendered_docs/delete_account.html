<h1>How do I delete my account?</h1>
<p>We are very sad that you're considering the possibility of deleting 
your account and leaving the Sagebrew community, but that is your right. If
there is something you're having difficulty with or a reason you're looking 
to delete your account please let us know and we'll do our best to help 
resolve the issue.</p>
<p>To delete your account all you have to do to delete your account is to go to 
your profile, click on your account settings tab, navigate to the "delete my 
account" option at the bottom and follow the instructions provided. You will 
receive an email confirmation that your account has been deleted. After you've 
deleted your account, we will keep the records of your friends, conversations, 
site preferences, <a href="/help/privileges/participate_in_the_conversation/">privileges</a>, <a href="/help/reputation/">reputation</a>, and badges for 30 days. If you 
decide to reinstate your account within this 30 day grace period you will 
regain full access to your account as it was prior to deletion. After the 
30 day grace period your information will be deleted and you will not be able 
to reinstate your account as it was. </p>
