<h1>I want to contribute to a candidate running for office....Where do I begin?</h1>
<p>First, you should make sure to check out the Missions and Quests of each of the
candidates running in your area as to gain a full scope of the race. A 
candidate's Mission will detail their goals and ideas, as well as their plan 
if they win the election. Once you've made your decision on which
candidate to support, on their Mission for the office they're running for you'll see a "Donate"
button. You can click this and select how much you'd like to donate to them.
If you don't want to contribute money, you can also easily notify the 
candidate you'd like to volunteer for their campaign. Click the "Volunteer" button 
next to the donate one to select what you'd like to help out with.
Campaigns are always looking for help and support. </p>
<p>If you've donated to a candidate through Sagebrew, you can track your candidate 
as the campaign progresses to ensure that they are moving forward as planned. 
This is great because it provides candidates the opportunity to prove their 
dedication and it provides users the opportunity to connect and support 
candidates that are achieving their goals.</p>
