<h1>I want to contribute to a candidate running for office....Where do I begin?</h1>
<p>First, you should make sure to check out the <a href="/quest/">Quest</a> of each of the
candidates running in your area as to gain a full scope of the race. A 
candidate's Quest will detail their goals and ideas, as well as their plan 
if they win the election. Once you've made your decision on which
candidate to support, on their Quest you'll see a "Donate" button 
next to their name and their short biography. You can view their campaign 
plans and <a href="/help/donating/goals/">Goals</a> and decide to contribute as much or little as you'd 
like. If you don't want to contribute money, you can see if your candidate is 
hosting any rallies or events that you could attend, or even volunteer for. 
Campaigns are always looking for help and support. </p>
<p>If you've donated to a candidate through Sagebrew, you can track your candidate 
as the campaign progresses to ensure that they are moving forward as planned. 
This is great because it provides candidates the opportunity to prove their 
dedication and it provides users the opportunity to connect and support 
candidates that are achieving their goals. For further details about the 
donation system, check out the <a href="/help/donating/goals/">What are Goals?</a></p>
