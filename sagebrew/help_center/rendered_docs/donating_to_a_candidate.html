<h1>I want to contribute to a candidate running for office....Where do I begin?</h1>
<p>First, you should make sure to check out the Action Pages of each of the 
candidates running in your area as to gain a full scope of the race. A 
candidates Action Page will detail their goals and ideas, as well as their plan 
if they win the election. Once you've made your well-informed decision on which
candidate to support, on their Action Page you'll see a "Donate" button 
underneath that candidates' Donation Goals. You can view their campaign 
plans and Donation Goals and decide to contribute as much or little as you'd 
like. If you don't want to contribute money, you can see if your candidate is 
hosting any rallies or events that you could attend, or even volunteer for. 
Campaigns are always looking for help and support. If nothing else, send them 
an encouraging message! Moral support can be just as helpful as monetary 
support! </p>
<p>If you've donated to a candidate through Sagebrew, you can track your candidate 
as the campaign progresses to ensure that they are moving forward as planned. 
This is great because it provides candidates the opportunity to prove their 
dedication and it provides citizens the opportunity to connect and support 
candidates that are achieving their goals. If a candidate you've donated to 
doesn't seem to be following through on their current Donation Goal, or if 
new light has been shed on your candidate that changes your mind about 
supporting them, you can revoke any donations you made that have not been 
released to the candidate yet. For further details about the donation system,
