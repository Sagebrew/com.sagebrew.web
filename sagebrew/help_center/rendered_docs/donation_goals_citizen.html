<h1>What are Donation Goals?</h1>
<p>Donation Goals are a way for a candidate running for office to fundraise and 
organize their campaign needs and objectives.</p>
<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<p>Donation Goals work in rounds. A candidate will first set a round of Donation 
Goals. Each Donation Goal will have a specific, tangible follow through, such 
as launching a commercial or holding a rally. Once a Donation Goal is reached, 
the funding for that goal will be released to the candidate.</p>
<p>For Example:</p>
<p>Reginald is running for office. Reginald has set his first round of donation 
Goals. His first Donation goal is set at $5000. The tangible follow through for 
this first goal is to conduct a statewide poll to determine his popularity. 
Reginald will not receive any funds until he has reached his $5000 donation 
goal, at which point he will receive that $5000 and be able 
to follow through on his promise. Any funding he receives after that $5000 
dollar Donation Goal will roll over into his next Donation Goal.</p>
<h2>Follow up</h2>
<p>With each Donation Goal a candidate must set a tangible follow up. This 
ensures that both candidate and donors know how and why their money is being 
spent. After the Donation Goal has been reached the candidate will be able to 
follow through on their goal.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A candidate MUST provide an update showing evidence of their 
follow up or an update on its progress before users 
will be charged for their donations towards the next Donation Goal. 
The purpose of this is to increase transparency between donors and candidates 
so that the donors can track their donations and the candidates they donate 
to.</p>
<h2>Good Donation Practice</h2>
<p>A few tips for donors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of your donations and make sure the candidates you donate to are 
  following through with their Donation Goals</li>
<li>Make sure to read over the Donation Goals, both short and long term, of the 
  candidates you contribute to. You want to know that you're donating to a 
  worthy candidate who will be responsible with your contributions.</li>
<li>Reach out to those you'd like to contribute to. Send them a message if you 
  have any questions, concerns, or ideas.</li>
</ul>
