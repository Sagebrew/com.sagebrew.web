<p>Your Mission's Epic is the page that tells everyone about your
Mission. Some ideas on what to include are what are you trying to accomplish, 
how are you planning on accomplishing it, who is it going to affect, and so on. This 
is your page, add text, images, and videos to showcase your cause or 
campaign to the world. Whether you're advocating or campaigning for office your 
Epic will help you win over other's to your Mission.</p>
<h2>How to Setup</h2>
<p>When you first start your mission you'll be dropped on your Mission's page. Here 
you'll see some prepopulated text and images that you can modify to your needs.</p>
<p>If you scroll down you should see something like the following:</p>
<p><img alt="default epic layout" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sagebrew/long_term_static/help/default_epic.png" /></p>
<p>To replace the default text with your Mission's information just click the settings
link.</p>
<p><img alt="select settings" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sagebrew/long_term_static/help/select_settings_epic.gif" /></p>
<h2>Editing Your Epic</h2>
<p>Once you've reached the Epic management console you can use the input box 
to create a page that outlines what makes your Mission 
important. You can include links, quotes, images, videos, headers, lists, and 
set text to be bold or italic. We describe how to use Markdown more extensively in our 
article describing <a href="/help/policies/markdown-formatting/">Markdown Formatting</a>.</p>

<p>Please be aware that if you're including a video from YouTube, Vimeo, or some 
other service it may not show up in the preview window of the Epic management console. </p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>You should make sure to setup your Epic prior to taking your Mission live otherwise
there will be a blank page displayed to the world. You can update it at any time 
and we'd recommend doing so as your Mission progresses. You can provide updates 
to your followers, volunteers, and contributors with <a href="/help/quest/update-management/">Updates</a> but it's always good 
to have up to date information located in your Epic.</p>
