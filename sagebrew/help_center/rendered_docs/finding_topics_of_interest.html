<h1>How do I find topics I'm interested in?</h1>
<p>We understand that each of our users will have different interests and agendas, 
therefore we've made it easy to follow topics that you're interested in. 
When creating an account we will ask you to select the topics that interest 
you. By checking the box next to any of the topics we present, you will 
tailor your feed to provide discussions associated with your selection. If you'd 
like to adjust your topics of interest you can do so by accessing your account 
settings, navigating your way down to the "Interests" and unchecking any of the 
previously checked threads or checking additional topics you'd like to start
following.</p>
