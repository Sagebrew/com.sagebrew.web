<h1>What should a solution contain?</h1>
<p>Here at Sagebrew we believe a should include your solution to a problem 
backed up by <a href="/help/conversation/research/">evidence</a>. A solution should provide 
reasonable, achievable goals, and should operate in a realistic fashion 
(i.e. creating a shrink ray and shrinking everyone on the planet is not a 
viable solution to the problem of overpopulation, unless you have an operational
shrink ray). </p>
<p>Solutions should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take into consideration as many aspect of the problem as possible</li>
<li>Be financially achievable</li>
<li>Attempt to solve the root of the problem rather than a symptom</li>
<li>Benefit those affected in the greatest possible way</li>
</ul>
<p>A solution is usually the result of
iterative revisions assisted by feedback from the 
community in the form of <a href="/help/privileges/comment/">Comments</a> and alternative Solutions. So keep an eye 
out for other community members asking for clarification or providing feedback with 
their own view on your solution.</p>
