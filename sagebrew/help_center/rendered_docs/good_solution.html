<h1>How do I write a good solution?</h1>
<p>Writing a good solution is an art. A good solution must be well thought out, 
logically sound, <a href="/help/conversation/research/">evidence</a> based and insightful. A good solution should provide 
reasonable, achievable goals, and should operate in a realistic fashion 
(i.e. creating a shrink ray and shrinking everyone on the planet is not a 
viable solution to the problem of overpopulation, unless you have an operational
shrink ray). </p>
<p>A good solution will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take into consideration every aspect of the problem</li>
<li>Be financially reasonable</li>
<li>Expose the core of the problem and build from there as opposed to fixing a 
  smaller problem that stems from a larger problem</li>
<li>Benefit those affected in the greatest possible way</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing a good solution takes time, dedication, and a lot of thought. 
A good solution doesn't appear overnight. A good solution is the result of 
hard mental labor and iterative revision assisted by feedback from the 
community in the form of <a href="/help/privileges/comment/">Comments</a> and alternative Solutions.</p>
