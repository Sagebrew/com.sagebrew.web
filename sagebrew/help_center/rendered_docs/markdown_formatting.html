<p>Technically speaking Markdown is a formatting language that produces plain 
text that can be easily converted to HTML. What that means is, Markdown is a 
writing system that allows easy customization of plain text, specifically 
including headers, ordered lists, block quotations, bold and italics, 
links etc. With Markdown it becomes very simple to write up Questions and 
Solutions, providing <a href="/help/questions/context/">Context</a>, citing sources and organizing the information 
you wish to present.</p>
<h2>The Specifics</h2>
<h3>Spaces and Lines</h3>
<p>If you wish to begin a new paragraph, you'll need to hit enter twice to tell 
Markdown you wish to begin a new paragraph. Markdown does not reconginze a 
single line as a new line. For example:</p>
<pre><code>this
is 
a 
single
line
</code></pre>
<p>will translate to:</p>
<pre><code>This is a single line
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas: </p>
<pre><code>This is

a new line
</code></pre>
<p>will translate to:</p>
<pre><code>This is

a new line
</code></pre>
<h3>Headers</h3>
<p>Headers are indicated by hash tags. For example:</p>
<pre><code># Header #
</code></pre>
<p>will translate to:</p>
<h1>Header</h1>
<p>The number of hash tags preceding a header will determine the size of the 
header. Six <code>#</code> symbols is the smallest Header. Any more than 6 <code>#</code> symbols 
and the text will remain the same.</p>
<p>A full list of header examples can be found below:</p>
<pre><code># Header One #
## Header Two ##
### Header Three ###
#### Header Four ####
##### Header Five #####
###### Header Six ######
</code></pre>
<p>The render to the following respectively:</p>
<h1>Header One</h1>
<h2>Header Two</h2>
<h3>Header Three</h3>
<h4>Header Four</h4>
<h5>Header Five</h5>
<h6>Header Six</h6>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
<p>To make an ordered list, simply use the dash, or <code>-</code> key. For example: </p>
<pre><code>- list one
- list two  
- list three
</code></pre>
<p>will translate to</p>
<ul>
<li>list one</li>
<li>list two</li>
<li>list three</li>
</ul>
<p>To nest the list, use 4 spaces before the <code>-</code> symbol. 
For example:</p>
<pre><code>- list one
    - list two
</code></pre>
<p>will translate to</p>
<ul>
<li>list one<ul>
<li>list two</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ordered Lists are a great way to organize thoughts and ideas.  </p>
<h3>Adding Links</h3>
<p>To add a link, simply place the word or words you'd like linked in brackets
(it's best to link a word or two). Then, at the bottom of your page, 
define your link. For example:</p>
<pre><code>This is a [link].

... Some Content ...

[link]: https://www.google.com
</code></pre>
<p>will translate to </p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.google.com">link</a>. </p>
<p>This will let the text editor know that your bracketed <a href="https://www.google.com">link</a> will take you to 
the designated web address. You may also use numbers to designate links. 
For example:</p>
<pre><code>This is a [link][1]

... Some Content ...

[1]: https://www.google.com
</code></pre>
<p>will translate to</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.google.com">link</a></p>
<p>This is a great method for citing sources within the Context of a Question or
a Solution. </p>
<h3>Block Quotes</h3>
<p>To add block quotes to your text, use the right-facing arrow key, <code>&gt;</code> to 
indicate that a line of text should be a block quote. For Example</p>
<pre><code>&gt; this is what block quotes would look like
&gt; when arranged in Markdown formatting. 
&gt; It's really not difficult at all!
</code></pre>
<p>would translate to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is what block quotes would look like
when arranged in Markdown formatting.
It's really not difficult at all!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by simply placing a <code>&gt;</code> before a line of text, you get nice, 
neat block quotes! This becomes helpful when quoting text or speech, 
especially when citing one of your <a href="/help/conversation/research/">research studies</a> or journal articles. </p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>To add images, put an exclamation point <code>!</code> before brackets containing an 
image description, and a number for reference in separate brackets.
Then, at the bottom of your page, define your image by the number
For example:</p>
<pre><code>![Theo the Dog][2]

... Some Content ...

[2]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/sagebrew/theo.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>would translate to:</p>
<p><img alt="Theo the Dog" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sagebrew/theo.jpg" /></p>
<p>This will let the editor know which image to use, and where. 
Our editor will automatically resize your image to fit neatly on the page if it
is too large, but if you can resize your image, it's recommended to do so.
Preferred image size is at or below 696x696.</p>
<h3>Videos</h3>
<p><em>Please note that we currently don't allow videos in the Conversation Cloud and
any raw HTML shall be stripped out of the input for security reasons. Videos can only
be inserted into Quests that you have edit rights to.</em>
To add a video, copy the "embedded" link from the host site of the video you'd like to post and
insert it in the document where you'd like the video to be located.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/120960412" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/120960412"&gt;Baxter&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/tcoyle"&gt;Ty Coyle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>would translate to:</p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/120960412" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><small><a href="https://vimeo.com/120960412">Baxter</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/tcoyle">Ty Coyle</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</small></p>
<h3>Preformatted Text</h3>
<p>To add preformatted text, simply indent your desired text 4 spaces. This will 
place your text in a special block that retains 
formatting such as spacing and indentation. Basically, your text will 
look exactly as you write it (Please note that copying and pasting in text from
something like Word will not maintain its formatting due to Word's proprietary 
formatting). An example of this formatting is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Here is some formatted text
     that will translate exactly how you write it
</code></pre>
<p>This can be helpful when trying to specifically format something in Markdown 
that the editor doesn't easily allow, such as preserving extra spaces or 
line breaks.</p>
<p>The other solution for adding preformatted text is to surround your text with
<code>`</code>s. This will result in an inline preformatting which doesn't handle spacing
but does allow for you to specify pieces of text you don't want the markdown
editor to interpret. For example:</p>
<pre><code>`#### This shouldn't be a header ####`
</code></pre>
<p>would translate to <code>#### This shouldn't be a header ####</code> rather than:</p>
<h4>This shouldn't be a header</h4>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You must leave a blank line between your previous, non-formatted, text 
and your preformatted text if you are using the 4 spaces rather than <code>`</code>s.</p>
<h3>Italics</h3>
<p>To make Italics, simply surround the words you want italicized with <code>*</code>. 
For example:</p>
<pre><code>*Hello, this is italicized. Isn't that a neat word? Italicized.*
</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<p><em>Hello, this is italicized. Isn't that a neat word? Italicized.</em> </p>
<h3>Bold</h3>
<p>To make text Bold, simply surround the words you want to be bold with two <code>*</code>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>**This text, on the other hand, is now bold.**
</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<p><strong>This text, on the other hand, is now bold.</strong></p>
