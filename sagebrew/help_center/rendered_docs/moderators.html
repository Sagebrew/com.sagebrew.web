<h1>Who are the site moderators, and what is their role here?</h1>
<p>Sagebrew is moderated by a panel of dedicated users called the 
<a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a>. To join the Admin Council you must be a Sagebrew member,
have achieved at least 10,000 <a href="/help/reputation/">Reputation</a> and the <a href="/help/privileges/brewmaster/">Brewmaster</a> rank. 
10,000 Reputation may seem like a steep goal, but we want to ensure that our 
moderators are dedicated and trusted users who will use this privilege 
responsibly. Any ranks beyond Brewmaster, such as the <a href="/help/privileges/tribune/">Tribune</a> Rank 
will retain their moderator status but no additional Admin
privileges will be awarded to any rank higher than Brewmaster. </p>
<p>The role of the Admin council is to keep Sagebrew running fluidly, and to 
keep Sagebrew a mature and friendly space. The Admin Council's duties include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting to <a href="/help/conversation/deletions/">Remove Flagged Material</a><ul>
<li>The voting system is democratic. A 2/3 majority among participating Admins 
   is required to remove <a href="/help/privileges/flagging/">flagged</a> material. If no flagged material has been 
   voted on after two full days it will be removed. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/help/conversation/closed/">Closing Conversations</a> <ul>
<li>A conversation may become closed if it is voted to be not up to par. 
  Closed Conversations aren't removed, but simply grayed out and closed 
  off to further interaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closing and Linking <a href="/help/questions/duplicates/">Duplicate</a> Questions <ul>
<li>If a Question is found to be a duplicate, it will be closed and a link to 
  the more relevant Conversation will be provided. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Place <a href="/help/conversation/protected/">Protection</a> on Conversations<ul>
<li>In the case that a Conversation is being unnecessarily flagged or attacked, 
  but it is decided to be a good Conversation, an Admin may place Protection on 
  that conversation so that only members with higher reputation can interact
  with the content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of the Admin Council as the "elders" of the Sagebrew community. They've 
been around and can be trusted to take care of their responsibilities. </p>
