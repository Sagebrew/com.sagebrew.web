<h1>Who are the site moderators, and what is their role here?</h1>
<p>Sagebrew is moderated by a panel of dedicated users called the 
<a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a>. To join the Admin Council you must be a Sagebrew member 
and have achieved at least 10,000 <a href="/help/reputation/">Reputation</a> and the <a href="/help/privileges/brewmaster/">Brewmaster</a> rank. 
10,000 Reputation may seem like a steep goal, but we want to ensure that our 
moderators are dedicated and trusted users who will use this privilege 
responsibly. Any ranks beyond Brewmaster, such as the <a href="/help/privileges/tribune/">Tribune</a> Rank 
(12,500 reputation) will retain their moderator status but no additional Admin
privileges will be awarded to any rank higher than Brewmaster. </p>
<p>The role of the Admin council is to keep Sagebrew running fluidly, and to 
keep Sagebrew a mature and friendly space. The Admin Council's duties include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting to <a href="/help/conversation/why_are_questions_deleted/">remove flagged material</a><ul>
<li>The voting system is democratic. A 2/3 majority among participating Admins 
  is required to delete flagged material. If no <a href="/help/privileges/flagging/">flagged</a> material has been 
  voted on after two full days it will be deleted. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/help/conversation/closure_of_a_question/">Closing conversations</a> # TODO</li>
<li>Removing <a href="/help/conversation/duplicate_questions/">duplicate</a> questions # TODO</li>
<li>Place <a href="/help/conversation/protected_conversation/">Protection</a> on conversations<ul>
<li>In the case that a conversation is being unnecessarily flagged or attacked, 
  but it is decided to be a good conversation, an Admin may place Protection on 
  that conversation so it may no longer be flagged. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of the Admin Council as the "elders" of the Sagebrew community. They've 
been around and can be trusted to take care of their responsibilities. </p>
