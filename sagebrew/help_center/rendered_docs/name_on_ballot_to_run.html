<h1>Do I have to have my name on the ballot to run for federal office?</h1>
<p>Initially, no, you do not have to have your name on the ballot to run for 
federal office. Once you've risen $5000 or once your campaign expenditures
have exceed $5000 you must then register with the FEC to get your name on the 
ballot. See <a href="/help/name_on_ballot/">How do I get my name on the ballot.</a></p>
