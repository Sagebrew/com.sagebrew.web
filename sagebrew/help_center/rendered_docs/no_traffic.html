<h1>What should I do if my Question gets no traffic?</h1>
<p>If your Question has received no Upvotes or Downvotes, no Comments or Solutions, 
there may be a couple of issues with your Question.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have incorrectly Tagged your Question. Incorrectly Tagging a Question 
  (i.e. Posing a Question about increasing poverty in the middle class and 
  tagging it "Science") may result in your Question being lost without seeing 
  much traffic.</li>
<li>Your Question might have been poorly constructed. You may have asked a poor 
  Question, or failed to support your Question with proper <a href="/help/questions/context/">Context</a>. To see an 
  example of a good question, check out our <a href="/help/questions/good_question/">How do I create a good question?</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe you've put together a well constructed Question and provided 
quality Context as well as proper Tags but your Question didn't generate any 
conversation, you can always Upgrade it. Upgrading a Question 
simply means that you are going to improve the quality and presentation of your 
Question. To assist with this process, take your Question back to the drawing 
board and ask yourself a few questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who does the issue at hand effect?</li>
<li>Why is this Question important?</li>
<li>What is at stake?</li>
<li>Can you re-word your Question or take a different angle that might help it 
  gain attention and reach a wider audience?</li>
</ul>
<p>After you've addressed these issues, and maybe some others that are more 
specific to your Question, go ahead and Upgrade your Question. Upgraded 
Questions will make their way to the top of the "Most Recently Edited 
Questions" filter in the Conversation Area search, giving your Question 
another chance to be discovered.</p>
