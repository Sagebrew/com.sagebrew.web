<h1>Why have I been limited to one Question per week?</h1>
<p>We want all of our users at Sagebrew to assist in fostering a community in 
which Questions are taken seriously and Solutions are thoughtfully provided. 
We're limiting you to one Question per week to encourage thoughtful Questions 
and not clog the Sagebrew feed with half-hearted ones. This also helps ensure 
that your Question receives the proper attention it deserves and promotes 
healthy and meaningful debate.</p>
