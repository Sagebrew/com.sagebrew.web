<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>Sagebrew values your privacy. Unlike other social websites we aren't selling your personal data to advertisers. What you do on your wall and your friends walls stays between you, them, and your circle of friends.</p>
<h3>Personal Privacy</h3>
<p>Posts that you make outside of the Conversation Area are private and only your friends will be able to view them. Only friends may view posts that you make to your own page, as well as any images or video that you share. Posts made on friends walls will enable their friends to see the post but that's where it ends.</p>
<h3>The Public Conversation</h3>
<p>In the Conversation everything that you share will be completely public. Other members will be able to see your name, your reputation, and any text, images, or video that you share in a Question, Comment, or Solution.</p>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>Quest Subscribers's information will be made public so that anyone may look them up, understand their ideas and policies, and make informed decisions on whether or not to support them. Sagebrew supports full transparency within the realm of public office, and we think the public has a right to know what's going on with those representing them.</p>
<h3>Contributions</h3>
<p>Contributions are not necessarily private. Quest subscribers that you donate to will be able to see your name, address, email and any FEC mandated information as pertains to said donation. Please note when a Quest subscriber signs up they agree to not utilize this information for anything other than filing the donation with the FEC. If they are caught doing so their account will be suspended and potentially terminated. Sagebrew does not offer the ability for a completely anonymous donation, therefore assume that donations are not completely private. </p>
<h3>Privacy Priority</h3>
<p>Your privacy is our priority. If you feel as though your privacy isn't being protected, or if you've found a bug or loophole in our privacy filters, contact us and let us know!</p>
