<h1>Can I convert a private conversation into a public one?</h1>
<p>You cannot convert a private conversation to a public conversation. When you 
start a private conversation you adopt the promise that all proposed solutions 
and comments will remain private to protect the users involved. If you have a 
private conversation that you'd like to move to the public conversation area 
you will need to resubmit the question in the public forum and begin the 
process again. </p>
<p>The primary reason for this is to protect other users who have 
contributed to a private conversation but might not want their responses made 
public.</p>
