<h1>What does it mean if a Conversation is "Protected"?</h1>
<p>A Protected Conversation is a Conversation that has been around for at least a 
day and a member from the <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a> has deemed "Protected." What 
this means is that in order to further contribute to the Conversation, a user 
must have at least 50 <a href="/help/reputation/">Reputation</a>. A conversation may become Protected if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is generating excess Spam</li>
<li>There are no relevant new Solutions being posed</li>
<li>A Solution has been determined, but it has not yet received 1000+ Upvotes</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Solution reaches 1000+ Upvotes it becomes <a href="/help/conversation/seasoned/">Seasoned</a>. </p>
