<h1>What types of Questions should I avoid asking?</h1>
<p>Questions to avoid asking on Sagebrew are Questions that</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear cut and simple solution<ul>
<li>For example, don't ask why the sky is blue, or
  why tomatoes are acidic. These are questions that a simple
  internet search can solution. Sagebrew is for tough questions. Questions
  that don't have clear cut solutions and questions that
  pose a moral or ethical problem. The goal of Sagebrew is for
  people to work together to solve problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions that are inherently offensive or inappropriate.<ul>
<li>Don't ask questions that target groups of people in a
  negative way, or otherwise threaten the safety/rights of
  groups of people or individuals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions that lean heavily to one side without considering
  the other side<ul>
<li>For example, a Question such as "How can liberals justify
  killing unborn children?" is not the kind of Question
  you should ask on Sagebrew. This Question clearly targets
  liberals and does not take their point of view into consideration. A 
  better Question to ask might be "In the case of Abortions, what 
  constitutes life and how can we better prevent situations that lead to 
  abortions?" Or perhaps, "How can we better educate children to prevent 
  situations of unwanted pregnancy?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally on Sagebrew you should strive to ask the difficult Questions
that have no clear cut solution. Questions should generate positive discussion
with the goal to improve a situation or issue. </p>
