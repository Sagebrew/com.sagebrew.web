<h1>Why are Questions no longer being accepted by my account?</h1>
<p>There are a few reasons that might lead to
an inability to spark Questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple of your Questions have been flagged
 for inappropriate or offensive conduct.</li>
<li>
<p>If you have been sparking Questions that are
  considered offensive or inappropriate you are
  not generating helpful Conversation, but rather distracting
  from real Conversation. This will result in the
  temporary suspension of your privilege to spark Questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Questions have repeatedly been Downvoted and are
determined to be largely unhelpful or unoriginal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you've been sparking Questions that aren't offensive
 or inappropriate, but simply poor quality, your privilege to spark
 Questions may be temporarily suspended. In this case, we suggest
 reading through some other Questions and Solutions to get
 an idea of what is expected in a Question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your account has been flagged for misconduct or
 inappropriate or offensive activity.</p>
</li>
<li>If your account has been flagged for misconduct, all
 of your privileges, including sparking Questions,
 will be temporarily suspended.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unhappy with Sagebrew's decision to suspend any of your
privileges, you may open a ticket and email the Sagebrew Support team with
your concerns or issues.</p>
