<p>The only circumstance that would lead to this happening is if another
user's account was terminated due to an  abuse of <a href="/help/privileges/upvote/">Upvoting</a> or <a href="/help/privileges/downvote/">Downvoting</a> or if 
their account was terminated for vote manipulation.</p>
<p>For example: say you posed a Solution to a Question and another user Downvoted 
your Solution. If that user has been caught trolling or spamming Downvotes or 
attempting to manipulate the popularity of a certain side of an issue that 
leads to the termination of their account, we would correct any <a href="/help/reputation/">Reputation</a> you 
lost as a result of that user's Downvoting. The same holds true for Upvotes. 
If another user Upvotes your Solution and is caught manipulating the voting 
system, any Reputation you gained as a result of that users Upvote will be 
taken away. </p>
<p>The primary reason for this is to discourage unfair or manipulative voting. 
We want the Conversation here to be honest and truthful, and we want Reputation 
to reflect that honesty and truth.</p>
