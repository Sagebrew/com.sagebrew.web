<h1>What does it mean if a Conversation is "Seasoned"?</h1>
<p>A Seasoned Conversation is a Conversation in which a single Solution has 
achieved 1000+ Reputation, dictating that a very solid Solution has been 
proposed and further Conversation will likely be unnecessary. To Comment 
or add another Solution to a Seasoned Conversation you will have to have 
accumulated 100 or more Reputation. <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a> members can no longer 
place <a href="/help/conversation/protected_conversation/">Protection</a> on a Seasoned Conversation. </p>
<p>It may prove beneficial for new users to peruse Seasoned Conversations to get 
an idea of what good discussion looks like. </p>
