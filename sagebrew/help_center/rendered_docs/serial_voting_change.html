<p>We've caught someone serial <a href="/help/privileges/upvote/">Upvoting</a> or <a href="/help/privileges/downvote/">Downvoting</a> one or more of 
your contributions. We've penalized the individuals responsible for these 
actions, and we've removed the gained or lost <a href="/help/reputation/">Reputation</a> from your account. 
We trust you and the greater community, to be honest with 
your <a href="/help/privileges/participate_in_the_conversation/">Privileges</a>, but sadly some people still might abuse them. 
We are sorry for the inconvenience, but Reputation gained or lost as a result of serial 
Up/Downvoting compromises the integrity of the site and detracts from 
meaningful conversation.  </p>
