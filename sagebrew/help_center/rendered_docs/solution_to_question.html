<h1>What should I do when someone provides a Solution to my Question?</h1>
<p>When someone provides a Solution to your Question you should read it 
thoroughly and consider it. Are they citing fact-based sources and 
<a href="/help/conversation/research/">evidence-based studies</a>? Is their solution logical? Practical? Reasonable? 
Ethical? After careful consideration you should then open up dialogue with them. 
This is an opportunity to talk about your Question and move forward. You 
should also give the Solution an Upvote if you think it's a good idea, or, 
if you think it's a really bad idea, you can Downvote the Solution. Either 
way, this is a chance for you to connect with someone and work together 
towards finding the best possible Solution.</p>
