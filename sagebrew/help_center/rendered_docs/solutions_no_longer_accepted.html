<h1>Why are Solutions no longer being accepted from my account?</h1>
<p>There are a few reasons that might lead to an inability to post Solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple of your Solutions have been <a href="/help/privileges/flagging/">flagged</a> for inappropriate or 
  offensive conduct. <ul>
<li>If you have been providing Solutions that are
  considered offensive or inappropriate, you are
  not adding to the <a href="/help/privileges/participate_in_the_conversation/">Conversation</a> but rather distracting
  from real Solutions. This will result in the
  temporary suspension of your <a href="/help/privileges/participate_in_the_conversation/">privilege</a> to provide Solutions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your Solutions have repeatedly been Downvoted and are
  determined to be largely unhelpful to the Conversation.<ul>
<li>If you've been providing solutions that aren't offensive
  or inappropriate, but provide no real value to the
  Conversation, your privilege to provide Solutions
  may be temporarily suspended. In this case, we suggest
  reading through some other Questions and Solutions to get
  an idea of what is expected in a Solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your account has been flagged for misconduct or for
  inappropriate or offensive activity.<ul>
<li>If your account has been flagged for misconduct, all
  of your privileges, including providing Solutions,
  will be temporarily suspended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unhappy with Community's and <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council's</a> decision to suspend 
any of your privileges we are sorry but we cannot assist in this matter. 
Outside of waiting out the suspension there are no tools for any Sagebrew 
Staff to reduce, remove, or modify, in any fashion, restrictions placed on a 
given user. This is meant to keep moderation in the hands of the community and 
remove potential for any bias treatment.</p>
