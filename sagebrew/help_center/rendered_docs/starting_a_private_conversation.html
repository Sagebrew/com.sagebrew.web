<h1>How do I start a private conversation?</h1>
<p>A Private Conversation is a conversation involving your friends. To start a 
private conversation go to your profile and click on the 
"+private conversation" button. The general public will not be able to 
access your private conversations or interact with them in any way. You will 
also receive no <a href="/help/reputation">Reputation</a> gain or loss due to activity in a private 
conversation. </p>
<p>What good is a private conversation, you ask? Think of private conversations 
like practice for public conversations. The stakes are low with no reputation 
on the line and you can accurately get a feel for how well your Question might 
perform at the public level if you wish to take it there. Private conversations 
are great for honing your debate skills, practicing proper source citing and 
proper debate etiquette. </p>
<p>If you're unsure how a Question will be received by the public, or if you're 
not sure that it's a quality Question, pose it as a private conversation first 
and see what kind of feedback you get. </p>
