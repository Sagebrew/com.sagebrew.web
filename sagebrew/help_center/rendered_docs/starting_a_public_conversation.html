<h1>How do I start a conversation?</h1>
<p>To start a public conversation, navigate to the 
Conversation Cloud by clicking it in the navigation bar. 
Once you're in the Conversation Cloud you'll want to look 
around and see if a conversation is already being had regarding the topic you 
have a Question on. If there isn't click the "Start a Conversation" button.
You will be taken to a page where you can enter your Question and the 
<a href="/help/questions/context/">Context</a> for it. There are four sections for you to enter information:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Question Title" is for the actual Question you are posing. </li>
<li>"Question Context" is where you will provide relevant information 
  that you've <a href="/help/conversation/research/">researched</a> that provides background to your Question. </li>
<li>"What Place is Affected?" is where you can indicate what location your Question relates to.
  This could be the anything from the city you live in to an entire country.</li>
<li>"Add Tags" is where you can enter in up to 5 tags that relate to the Question to help
  others to find it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="/help/privileges/participate_in_the_conversation/">Participate in the Conversation</a> article for
