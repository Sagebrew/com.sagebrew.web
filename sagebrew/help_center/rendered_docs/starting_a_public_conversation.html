<h1>How do I start a public conversation?</h1>
<p>To start a public conversation, navigate to the public 
conversation area by clicking the Public Conversation button at the top of the 
homepage. Once you're in the Public Conversation area you may enter your 
question in the "Spark a conversation" box. Once you've entered your question 
you will be taken to a page where you can enter the context for your question. 
There are two sections for you to enter information, the "question" space is 
for the actual question you are posing. The "context" space is where you will 
provide relevant information that you've researched that provides background 
to your question. Check out the <a href="/help/privileges/participate_in_the_conversation/">Participate in the Conversation</a> article for
best practices and more information.</p>
<p>After you click "Submit" your question will go live in the Public Conversation 
area and you will receive notifications whenever someone poses a Solution or 
a Comment is added to your Question.</p>
