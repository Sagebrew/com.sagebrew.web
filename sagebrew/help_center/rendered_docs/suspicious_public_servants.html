<h1>How do I report suspicious activity by a Quest?</h1>
<p>If you have a valid reason for believing that a candidate should be 
reported for suspicious activity, you may flag their Quest by clicking the <i class="fa fa-flag"></i>.
This will open a ticket where you'll be able to offer a reason for flagging 
the candidate. </p>
<p>Valid reasons for flagging a representative:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have not given a proper update after reaching a Donation Goal</li>
<li>They have not spent their donation funding as they had promised</li>
<li>They have been inactive and/or unresponsive for an extended period of time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> flag a candidate because you don't agree with their policies or 
beliefs. Flagging candidates is reserved for suspicious or illegal 
activity only, not personal bias. </p>
