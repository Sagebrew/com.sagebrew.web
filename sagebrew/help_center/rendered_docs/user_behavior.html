<h1>What kind of behavior is expected of users?</h1>
<p>This one is pretty straightforward: we expect Sagebrew users to conduct 
themselves in a mature and respectful manner. Plain and simple. One of the 
primary goals of Sagebrew is to promote a safe and open environment that 
encourages users to participate and work together to find solutions to 
socio-political problems. Really, when in doubt just follow the golden rule: 
treat others how you'd like to be treated. For those who think, "oh, 
I will treat other's like dirt then because I don't mind being treated like 
dirt," we understand life can be rough and hope no one is treating you like 
dirt. We're sure we can't imagine the hardships you've gone through but we 
hope you'll reconsider and break the chain :).</p>
