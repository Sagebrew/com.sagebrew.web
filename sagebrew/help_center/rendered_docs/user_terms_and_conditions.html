<a href="/help/privileges/downvote/">Downvote</a> privilege articles.</p>
<p>Cheating or attempting to manipulate voting will result in your 
account being suspended pending termination. </p>

portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without 
the express written permission by Sagebrew.</p>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, hide Content and Accounts containing 
Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, 
threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise 
objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of 
Service. We reserve the right to remove content that is illegal in nature (such 
as child pornography) at our sole discretion and without notice at any time. </p>
<p>Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or 
retribution) of any Sagebrew customer, employee, member, or officer will 
result in immediate account suspension. Further investigation may result in

"spam" messages.</p>
<p>You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.</p>
<p>If your bandwidth usage significantly exceeds the average bandwidth usage 
(as determined solely by Sagebrew) of other Sagebrew customers, we reserve 
the right to immediately disable your account or throttle your usage until 
you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</p>
<p>Sagebrew does not warrant that (i) the service will meet your specific 
requirements, (ii) the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or 
error-free, (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the 
service will be accurate or reliable, (iv) the quality of any products,

service; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or 
data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third-party on the service; (v) or any 
other matter relating to the service.</p>
<p>Based on current legal regulations Sagebrew discourages felons from 
pledging to vote for a representative (as you are legally not permitted to 
vote in any election and your pledge would be an empty one). Sagebrew does not 
agree with this facet of the law, but alas we feel obligated to iterate it. </p>

<p>The failure of Sagebrew to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the 
Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

you and Sagebrew (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the 
Terms of Service). You agree that these Terms of Service and Your use of the 
Service are governed under Michigan law.</p>
<p>Questions about the Terms of Service should be sent to <a href="mailto:support@sagebrew.com">support@sagebrew.com</a></p>

service in a government capacity, this Amendment to Sagebrew Terms of 
Service shall apply to you.</p>
<h2>Amendment I</h2>

<p><em>The following terms apply specifically to Representative accounts</em>
{% if debug == True %}
Adding Aides to manage their page (legal responsibility will still fall on 
the rep)
{% endif %}</p>
<p>Cancellation will require a phone call validation and short inquiry to assure 
the proper closing of a rep account</p>
<p>You are responsible for upholding any written Donation Goals that are fulfilled
in your Action Area.</p>
<p>by signing up for a rep account you are planning on actually running (don't 
just sign up and not run)</p>
<p>If you are a sitting member of public office you may not sign up for a 
standard account 
{% comment %}
we might want to change our stance on this since we now
distinguish the Action Area almost completely from the user's private profile. 
But we'd still greatly encourage this as the Action Area of a sitting 
representative will lack in fullness and not enable users to easy interact with them.
{% endcomment %}</p>
