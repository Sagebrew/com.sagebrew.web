<p>Don't use shill or multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software 
    to increase votes for submission.</p>

    being suspended pending termination. </li>

Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, 
written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof. The failure of either 
party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be

for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results 
from any cause beyond Sagebrew’s reasonable control, including, without 
limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. 
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, 
that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary 
so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and

Subscriber except with Sagebrew’s prior written consent. Sagebrew may assign 
this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without Subscriber’s consent.

result of this Agreement and Subscriber does not have any authority of any kind
