<p>Voting on Questions, Solutions and <a href="/help/privileges/comment/">Comments</a> is important because it provides 
helpful feedback and allows the community at large to see which ideas are the 
most popular and the most encompassing. Think of a vote as an indicator that 
you either agree with a Question, Solution, or Comment (<a href="/help/privileges/upvote/">Upvote</a>), or that 
you disagree (<a href="/help/privileges/downvote/">Downvote</a>). Thus, 
voting is Sagebrew's simplest way to show support or opposition and using 
your votes helps other users ensure that the <a href="/help/privileges/participate_in_the_conversation/">Conversation</a> is moving 
in the right direction. </p>
<h2>Two types of votes</h2>
<h3>Upvoting</h3>
<p>Shows support for a Question, Solution, or Comment. Upvote anything 
that you agree with to let that user know that 
you are interested in what they have to say and that you're on the same boat.</p>

<h3>Downvoting</h3>
<p>Downvoting shows opposition to a Question, Solution, or Comment. Downvote something 
that you strongly disagree with to let the 
author know that you are opposed to their view point. It might be beneficial to 
leave a Comment when Downvoting to explain your position, but it is not 
necessary. </p>
