<h1>Why is voting on Questions, Solutions, and Comments important?</h1>
<p>Voting on Questions, Solutions and <a href="/help/privileges/comment/">Comments</a> is important because it provides 
helpful feedback and allows the community at large to see which ideas are the 
most popular and the most encompassing. Think of a vote as an indicator that 
you either agree with a Question, Solution, or Comment (<a href="/help/privileges/upvote/">Upvote</a>), or that 
you disagree with a Question, Solution, or Comment (<a href="/help/privileges/downvote/">Downvote</a>). Thus, 
voting is Sagebrew's simplest way to show support or opposition and using 
your votes helps other users ensure that the <a href="/help/privileges/participate_in_the_conversation/">Conversation</a> is moving 
in the right direction. </p>
<h2>Two types of votes</h2>
<h3>Upvoting</h3>
<p>Shows support for a Question, Solution, or Comment. Upvote any Question, 
Solution, or Comment that you agree with to let that user know that 
you are interested in what they have to say and that you're on the same boat.</p>

<h3>Downvoting</h3>
<p>Downvoting shows opposition to a Question, Solution, or Comment. Downvote a 
Question, Solution, or Comment that you strongly disagree with to let the 
author know that you are opposed to their solution. It might be beneficial to

necessary. </p>
