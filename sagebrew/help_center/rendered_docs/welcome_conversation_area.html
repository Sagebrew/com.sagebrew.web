<h1>Welcome to the Conversation!</h1>
<p>This is the Conversation Area. Conversations here are public
and accessible by all users. How does it work?</p>
<h3>Ask Questions</h3>
<p>The Conversation begins with a Question. You can ask about
pretty much anything here. Topics include: Economic,
Foreign policy, Social, Education, Science, Environment
Drugs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Health, and Space. To get started you can read around
through other Questions to get a feel for the system if you'd
like. You'll find that good Questions that spark meaningful Conversation
are thoughtful, well-researched, and multi-faceted.
For examples of good Questions check out <a href="/help/questions/good_question/">How do I create a
good question?</a></p>
<p>Once you're ready to spark your own Question, you'll need to
provide some <a href="/help/questions/context/">Context</a> to help other users to better understand
your Question. Good things to include in the Context section are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why your question is important</li>
<li>Who will be affected by your Question?</li>
<li>Links to relevant information pertaining to your Question (journal
  articles, newspaper articles, quotes, <a href="/help/conversation/research/">research</a>, videos and other media)</li>
<li>Explanations of any important studies conducted about your
  Question</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll then need to Tag your question. This will Categorize your Question 
for Sagebrew's search engine, allowing other users to more easily find you.</p>
<p>Once you've entered your Question, provided appropriate Context,
and added Tags, you can spark your Question!</p>
<h3>Provide Solutions</h3>
<p>If you come across a Question that peaks your interest and
you think you might have a feasible way to solve the issue,
you should provide a Solution.</p>
<p>Good Solutions use fact-based evidence and consider every side
of an issue in an attempt to find the greatest compromise.
Considering things like monetary cost, practicality and efficiency,
good Solutions are flexible and usually the result of collaboration.
Work together to find the best Solutions to Questions!</p>
<h3>Leave Comments</h3>
<p>If you see a Question or Solution that needs clarification
or if you have relevant information that might affect that Question or
Solution, you should leave a Comment and open dialogue with that user.
Leaving comments is the most effective way to collaborate with others.
If you sparked the Question and another user provides a good Solution, leave
a comment and see if you can't refine that Solution to be the best it
can be.</p>
