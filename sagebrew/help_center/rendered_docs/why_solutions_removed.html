<h1>Why and how are some Solutions removed?</h1>
<p>Some of the reasons a Solution might be removed are detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Solution was <a href="/help/privileges/flagging/">Flagged</a> for containing inappropriate language,
  offensive language, or insults of any kind</li>
<li>A Solution didn't offer anything relevant to the conversation</li>
<li>A Solution was a <a href="/help/questions/duplicates/">duplicate</a> of another Solution</li>
</ul>
<p>For a Solution to be removed, it must first be flagged
by another user. Then, it will be put to a
vote in the <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a>. A 2/3 majority is required
from participating Admins to remove a Solution.</p>
<p>{% if debug == True %}
If you're unhappy with the pending or existing removal of a Solution,
you may appeal to have that decision reversed. Think of an appeal as a last effort to
sway the Admin Council's vote. Each Admin will have the opportunity to 
read your appeal and consider it during their vote.
