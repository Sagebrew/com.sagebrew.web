<h1>What happens when I donate to a Candidate? #</h1>
<p>After you've donated to a candidate you will receive an immediate email 
confirmation stating that you've donated "x" amount of money to candidate "y". 
Your donation will be held by Sagebrew until the candidate's Donation Goal has 
been reached, at which time you will receive a second email with a notification
that confirms your donation. The representative you donated to will also receive 
notice that you have donated to their cause. They will not receive anything 
more than your name, your district, and the amount you donated.  In the instance 
that a candidate does not reach their Donation Goal, your donation will be 
refunded minus a small transaction fee.</p>
