<h1>Why have my Questions or Solutions been blocked due to 'spam'?</h1>
<p>In order for a question to be blocked due to "spam" a couple things must 
happen. Another user must Flag your Question or Solution as spam. The <a href="/help_center/reputation/admin_council/">Admin 
Council</a> must then vote on the Flag and decide that, yes, it is spam. A 2/3 
majority among participating Admins is required to block a Question or 
Solution. You will then receive a notification that your Question or 
Solution has been blocked due to spam. </p>
<p>If multiple Questions and/or Solutions are labeled as spam in this way, your 
account will be blocked from adding additional contributions to the Public 
Conversation.</p>
