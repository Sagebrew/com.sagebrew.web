<h1>How to not be a spammer</h1>
<p>Nobody likes a spammer. But with the sheer number of 
spammers out there, the problem may be that some people don't know exactly what 
spamming is. Spamming is the repetitive posting of  anything irrelevant to the 
conversation. Spamming includes, but is not limited to: advertising, marketing, 
posting links to irrelevant websites, malicious links, repetitive posting of 
the same information, etc. We want the conversation to be open and inviting, 
but we'd also like it to remain relevant and free from interruption. With that 
in mind, a surefire way to ensure that you aren't a spammer is to keep your 
posts relevant to the conversation.</p>
