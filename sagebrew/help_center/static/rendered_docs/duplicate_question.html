<h1>Why are some questions marked as duplicate?</h1>
<p>If your question has been marked as a Duplicate Question it is because 
the same question (or one very similar that is aimed at finding a Solution 
to the same issue) has already been asked and is in the midst of a discussion. 
The Sagebrew moderators close duplicate questions to keep the site neat
and focused. Also, duplicate questions divide the conversation between 
multiple parties, making it harder for a Solution to be reached. If we are 
all on the same page taking part in the same Conversation, it is easier to 
reach a Solution. Power in numbers!</p>
