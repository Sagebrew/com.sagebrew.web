<h1>I've reached my Donation Goal but there are no funds in my bank account</h1>
<p>There are a couple reasons your funds aren't yet in your
bank account.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have not provided your constituents with an update for
your previous Donation Goal. We'll not release funding unless
you're providing updates of your progress with the funding you've
raised thus far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may take up to two full business days for the transfer
to process and show up in your account depending on bank policies. If it has 
been more than two days and the funding still hasn't transferred, 
reach out to us by opening your Intercom (the little question mark 
on the bottom right of your screen).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any other issues with fundraising or other portions of 
Sagebrew we're always happy to help! We love to hear from you, please 
don't be shy about using the Intercom.</p>
