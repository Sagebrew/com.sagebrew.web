<h1>Why have I been limited to one question per week?</h1>
<p>We want all of our users at Sagebrew to assist in fostering a community in 
which questions are taken seriously and answered thoughtfully. We're limiting 
you to one question per week to encourage thoughtful questions and not clog 
the Sagebrew feed with half-hearted ones. This also helps ensure that 
your question receives the proper attention it deserves and promotes healthy 
and meaningful debate.</p>
