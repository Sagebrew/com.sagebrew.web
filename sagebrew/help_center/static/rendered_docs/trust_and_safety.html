<h1>Community Values</h1>
<p>Here at Sagebrew our goal is to provide an efficient
and working system that fosters collaboration, trust, and
honesty. We work hard to solve issues with the site, we
actively listen to you, the community, for your needs and
desires, and we encourage open communication so we can
make Sagebrew a great experience for everyone.</p>
<h3>A few things for general users</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sagebrew provides a great platform for those seeking
to run for public office to do so. However, not all campaigns
will be successful and we advise you research your candidates
well before donating to them. We do our best to provide you
as full of a picture as possible of each candidate, but
ultimately we cannot provide every last detail. You should
check multiple sources before choosing to donate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although it's easier to communicate with your representatives
and candidates than ever, we cannot promise that they'll respond
immediately, or at all. Representatives are busy, and it may be
that they cannot answer your concerns for a week or two. Sagebrew
cannot force representatives to respond to their constituents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public Conversation area is a great tool for talking
  about and instigating change, but only if we collaborate
  and respect each other's ideas and insights. If you see
  inappropriate or offensive activity, don't be afraid to Flag
  it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We encourage openness and honesty, and by striving
to listen to the community and address issues as they arise
we hope that you'll follow our lead and help us keep
Sagebrew working and growing. We'd greatly appreciate it if you
reported any issues or problems with the site, and we trust that
you'll report them and not attempt to exploit them in any way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-Open communication with your representatives and those running for office in your area. Open communication is what a democracy is all about. The more information exchanged between individuals and those representing groups of individuals, the better.</p>
<h3>A few things for candidates and sitting representatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's best to be as clear and concise as possible when laying
out your Donation Goals and Rounds. You'll want to make sure
your contributors know that their money is being used as they'd
hoped. This also creates a meaningful relationship between
you and your contributors and encourages others to get involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take an active role in the Conversation. This will help show your constituents how you solve problems, how you
strategize, and why you stand for your ideals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sagebrew's role here</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We auto-remove things like spam, someone selling products, etc. If it's clearly not legitimate, you won't ever see it. We like to run a clean ship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do our best to ensure that there's only one user per person. Multiple accounts can mess up data and provide incorrect voting expectations. We have a secure system in place to ensure each citizen only has one account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We keep the site third party advertisement free, and we'll never sell your information to anyone. What you post and share here remains here. Unlike other social media sites we do not make our money by selling information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
