<h1>When should I edit my Solution?</h1>
<p>You should edit your Solution if you find new evidence to support
your Solution, or if you believe other users don't fully understand
 your solution and you can word it better. In many cases editing a
 solution can change the original intent of the Solution, in which
 instance it would be better to provide a new Solution. </p>
