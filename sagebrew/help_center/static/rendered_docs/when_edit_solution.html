<h1>When should I edit my Solution?</h1>
<p>You should edit your Solution if you find new evidence to support
your Solution, or if you believe other users don't fully understand
your solution and you can word it better. Solutions are ever-evolving ideas 
that grow through the feedback provided by the community via <a href="/help_center/privileges/commenting/">Comments</a> and 
alternative Solutions.</p>
<p>In the case that editing a solution completely changes the original
intent of the Solution, it might be better to provide a new Solution. </p>
