<h1>Why and how are some Questions deleted?</h1>
<p>There are a few reasons a question might be deleted on Sagebrew.</p>
<ol>
<li>The question may have been flagged as containing offensive, inappropriate, 
or harmful language or images. </li>
<li>The question may be a duplicate.</li>
<li>The question may have been of very low quality and/or without proper sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before a question is deleted it must first be flagged. After a question is 
flagged, it is put up to a vote for the Admin Council. A 2/3 majority of 
participating Admins is required for a question to be deleted. If no action 
is taken within two days, a flagged question will be deleted.</p>
