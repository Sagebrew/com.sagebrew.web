<h1>Why and how are some Questions deleted?</h1>
<p>For a Question to be deleted, it must have either been flagged as containing 
offensive, inappropriate, or harmful language or images, or it must have been 
caught by Sagebrew's system, marked as spam, and deleted.</p>
<p>Before a flagged question is deleted it must be put up to a vote for the 
Admin Council. A 2/3 majority of participating Admins is required for a 
question to be deleted. If no action is taken within two days, a flagged 
question will be deleted. </p>
<p>Questions may also be deleted if Sagebrew discovers that a Question, or any 
component of a Question, is plagiarized, illegal, patented, or otherwise 
belongs solely to another individual or organization. If a Question is found to
violate any of these there will not be an Admin Council vote for removal and 
further action may be taken against the user who posted the material.</p>
