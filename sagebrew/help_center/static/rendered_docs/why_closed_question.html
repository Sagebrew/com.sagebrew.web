<h1>What does it mean if a Question is Closed?</h1>
<p>A closed Question is a Question that has been determined to be lacking depth by 
the <a href="/help/reputation/admin_council/">Admin Council</a>. These questions aren't deleted, but instead are closed 
off to further interaction (no more Comments, Solutions, Upvotes or Downvotes) 
so they may stand as examples of Questions that need improvement. </p>
