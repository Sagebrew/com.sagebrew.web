            You will not be be charged until the Sagebrew Quest you donated to has received enough pledges
            to complete their current goal and has provided an update to all their previous ones. When this does happen
            we'll send you another email regarding the completed charge. Please make
            sure to keep an eye out for updates from the Quest and to keep interacting with your representatives :).
