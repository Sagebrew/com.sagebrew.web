Credit The Natural Environment Research Council A proposal by a British government agency to let the Internet name a $287 million polar research ship probably seemed like a good idea at the time. Now, the agency is the latest group to see what happens when web users are asked to unleash their creative energy: R.R.S. Boaty McBoatface is a clear front-runner. People quickly disregarded the more dignified names suggested by the Natural Environment Research Council \u2014 Shackleton, Endeavour, Falcon. Instead the contest became the latest in the Internet\u2019s long, storied history to end up with social media users gleefully offering ridiculous names to government-funded projects. The initiatives are often hilarious but don\u2019t often succeed. Remember when Slovak lawmakers overrode the public\u2019s vote in 2012 to rename a pedestrian bridge after the actor Chuck Norris? Or the debacle in Austin, Tex., a year earlier, when people unsuccessfully tried to name the city\u2019s waste management service after Limp Bizkit\u2019s frontman, Fred Durst? Corporations have also tried the tactic, and the penalty for trying to play with the Internet tends to be meaner: Mountain Dew learned the hard way when 4 Chan took control of a vote to name a new flavor, and the joke was on Taylor Swift and VH1 when the Internet chose a school for the deaf as a concert location. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story We have James Hand , a public relations professional and former BBC employee, to thank (blame?) for this latest episode. Mr. Hand became a bit of an overnight sensation when he submitted the name Boaty McBoatface after seeing reports of the competition last week. Then he watched his creation spin completely out of control. I'm terribly sorry about all of this, @NERCscience . \u2014 James Hand (@JamesHand) March 20, 2016 My apology for #BoatyMcBoatface was in the most British sense. I stand by it being a brilliant name. \u2014 James Hand (@JamesHand) March 21, 2016 \u201cThe storm that has been created has got legs of its own,\u201d Mr. Hand told the BBC on Monday, and added that he had submitted Boaty McBoatface in another competition . (For what it\u2019s worth, Mr. Hand voted for the name R.R.S. David Attenborough.) The research council would not comment on whether it would override the Internet\u2019s suggestion, but Alison Robinson, a spokeswoman, said in an email that the group was \u201cdelighted by the enthusiasm and creativity\u201d of people vying for names like Boaty McBoatface. The ship is scheduled to set sail in 2019. \u201cWe\u2019ve had thousands of suggestions made on the website since we officially launched; many of them reflect the importance of the ship\u2019s scientific role by celebrating great British explorers and scientists,\u201d Ms. Robinson said. \u201cWe are pleased that people are embracing the idea in a spirit of fun.\u201d Sure they are. The poll closes April 16 \u2014 that is, if the Natural Environment Research Council can ever get the crashed polling website back online again. ",
