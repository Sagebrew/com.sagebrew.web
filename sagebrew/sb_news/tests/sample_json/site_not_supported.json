        "text": "Opinion Why we should fear a cashless world Poor people and small businesses rely on cash. A contactless system will likely entrench poverty and pave the way for terrifying levels of surveillance \u2018Cash empowers its users. It enables them to buy and sell, and store their wealth, without being dependent on anyone else.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy Dominic Frisby Monday 21 March 2016 09.30 GMT Last modified on Monday 21 March 2016 09.32 GMT \nT he health food chain Tossed has just opened the UK\u2019s first cashless cafe . It\u2019s another step towards the death of cash. \nThis is nothing new. Money is tech. The casting of coins made shells, whales\u2019 teeth and other such primitive forms of money redundant. The printing press did the same for precious metals: we started using paper notes instead. Electronic banking put paid to the cheque. Contactless payment is now doing the same to cash, which is becoming less and less convenient. In the marketplace convenience usually wins. \nThat\u2019s fine as long as people are making this choice freely. What concerns me is the unofficial war on cash that is going on, from the suspicion with which you are treated if you ever use large sums of cash to the campaign in Europe to decommission the \u20ac500 note . I\u2019m not sure the consequences have been properly considered. \nRelated: Salad for one, served by machine? That\u2019s the saddest modern recipe | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett \nWe already live in a world that is, as far as the distribution of wealth is concerned, about as unequal as it gets. It may even be as unequal as it\u2019s ever been. My worry is that a cashless society may exacerbate inequality even further. \nIt will hand yet more power to the financial sector in that banks and related fintech companies will oversee all transactions. The crash of 2008 showed that, when push comes to shove, banks have already been exempted from the very effective regulation that is bankruptcy \u2013 one by which the rest of us must all operate. Do we want this sector to have yet more power and influence? \nIn a world without cash, every payment you make will be traceable. Do you want governments (which are not always benevolent), banks or payment processors to have potential access to that information? The power this would hand them is enormous and the potential scope for Orwellian levels of surveillance is terrifying. \nCash, on the other hand, empowers its users. It enables them to buy and sell, and store their wealth, without being dependent on anyone else. They can stay outside the financial system, if so desired. \nThere are many reasons, both moral and practical, to want this. In 2008 many rushed to take their money out of the banks. If the financial system really was as close to breaking point as we are told it was, then such actions are quite justified. When Cyprus\u2019s banks teetered on the cliff of financial disaster in 2011, we saw bail-ins. Ordinary people\u2019s money in deposit accounts was sequestered to bail out the system. If your life savings were threatened with confiscation to bail out a corporation you considered profligate, I imagine you too would rush to withdraw them. \nWe have seen similar panics in Greece and, to a lesser extent, across southern Europe. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, recently declared that banking was not fixed and that we would see financial panic again. In Japan, the central bank has imposed negative rates and you are charged by banks to store money. This is to try and goad people into spending, rather than saving. So much cash has been withdrawn from banks that there are now reports that the country has sold out of safes. \nThese are all quite legitimate reasons to want to exit the system. I\u2019m not saying we should all take our money out of the bank, but that we should all have the option to. Cash gives you that option. Why remove it? It\u2019s our money. Not the banks\u2019. \nThe telephone teaches us a useful lesson. At its peak in 2008, there were 1.3bn landlines for a global population close to 7 billion. Today more than 6 billion people have a mobile phone \u2013 more than have access to a toilet, according to a UN study. Many assume that the mobile succeeded where the landline failed, because the superior technology made widespread coverage more possible. There is something to that. \nBut the main reason, simply, is that, to get a landline, you need a bank account and credit. About half of the world\u2019s population is \u201cunbanked\u201d, without access to the basic financial services you need. Telecoms companies saw no potential custom, the infrastructure was never built and many were left with fewer possibilities to communicate. But a mobile phone and its airtime you can buy with cash. You don\u2019t need to be banked. Almost anyone can get a mobile \u2013 and they have. The financial system was actually a barrier to progress for the world\u2019s poor, while cash was a facilitator for them. \nSix billion people around the world will have a smartphone by 2020. They will have pretty much everything they need to participate in e-commerce \u2013 internet access, basically \u2013 except the financial inclusion. Which is why there will be a huge role to play in the future for new forms of digital cash \u2013 from Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa to bitcoin \u2013 money you can use even if you are not financially included. \nRelated: No wallet, no worries: Denmark considering cash-free shops \nCash has its uses for small transactions \u2013 a chocolate bar, a newspaper, a pint of milk \u2013 which, in the UK, are still uneconomic to process by other means. It will always be the fastest and most direct form of payment there is. I like to tip waiters, for example, in cash, knowing they will receive that money, without it being siphoned off by some unscrupulous employer. I also like to shop in markets, where I can buy directly from the producer knowing they will receive the money, without middle men shaving off their percentages. \nIt also has its uses for private transactions, for which there are many possible reasons, and by no means all of them illegal. Small businesses starting out need the cash economy. Poor people need the cash economy. The war on cash is a war on them. \nIf you listen to the scaremongering, you\u2019d start to think that all cash users are either criminals, tax evaders or terrorists. Sure, some use cash to evade tax, but it\u2019s paltry compared to the tax avoidance schemes Google and Facebook have employed. Google doesn\u2019t use cash to avoid tax. It\u2019s all done via legislative means. \nCash means total financial inclusion, a luxury the better-off take for granted. Without financial inclusion \u2013 and there will always be some who, for whatever reason, won\u2019t have it \u2013 you are trapped in poverty. So beware the war on cash. ",
