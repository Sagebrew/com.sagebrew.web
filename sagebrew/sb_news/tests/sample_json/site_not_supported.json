When Cyprus\u2019s banks teetered on the cliff of financial disaster in 2011, we saw bail-ins. Ordinary people\u2019s money in deposit accounts was sequestered to bail out the system.

So much cash has been withdrawn from banks that there are now reports that the country has sold out of safes. \nThese are all quite legitimate reasons to want to exit the system. I\u2019m not saying we should all take our money out of the bank, but that we should all have the option to. Cash gives you that option. Why remove it? It\u2019s our money. Not the banks\u2019. \nThe telephone teaches us a useful lesson. At its peak in 2008, there were 1.3bn landlines for a global population close to 7 billion. Today more than 6 billion people have a mobile phone \u2013 more than have access to a toilet, according to a UN study. Many assume that the mobile succeeded where the landline failed, because the superior technology made widespread coverage more possible. There is something to that. \nBut the main reason, simply, is that, to get a landline, you need a bank account and credit. About half of the world\u2019s population is \u201cunbanked\u201d, without access to the basic financial services you need. Telecoms companies saw no potential custom, the infrastructure was never built and many were left with fewer possibilities to communicate. But a mobile phone and its airtime you can buy with cash. You don\u2019t need to be banked. Almost anyone can get a mobile \u2013 and they have. The financial system was actually a barrier to progress for the world\u2019s poor, while cash was a facilitator for them. \nSix billion people around the world will have a smartphone by 2020. They will have pretty much everything they need to participate in e-commerce \u2013 internet access, basically \u2013 except the financial inclusion. Which is why there will be a huge role to play in the future for new forms of digital cash \u2013 from Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa to bitcoin \u2013 money you can use even if you are not financially included. \nRelated: No wallet, no worries: Denmark considering cash-free shops \nCash has its uses for small transactions \u2013 a chocolate bar, a newspaper, a pint of milk \u2013 which, in the UK, are still uneconomic to process by other means. It will always be the fastest and most direct form of payment there is. I like to tip waiters, for example, in cash, knowing they will receive that money, without it being siphoned off by some unscrupulous employer. I also like to shop in markets, where I can buy directly from the producer knowing they will receive the money, without middle men shaving off their percentages. \nIt also has its uses for private transactions, for which there are many possible reasons, and by no means all of them illegal. Small businesses starting out need the cash economy. Poor people need the cash economy. The war on cash is a war on them. \nIf you listen to the scaremongering, you\u2019d start to think that all cash users are either criminals, tax evaders or terrorists. Sure, some use cash to evade tax, but it\u2019s paltry compared to the tax avoidance schemes Google and Facebook have employed. Google doesn\u2019t use cash to avoid tax. It\u2019s all done via legislative means. \nCash means total financial inclusion, a luxury the better-off take for granted. Without financial inclusion \u2013 and there will always be some who, for whatever reason, won\u2019t have it \u2013 you are trapped in poverty. So beware the war on cash. ",

      "text": "Text smaller Text bigger \nA growing number of drivers working for Uber, Lyft and similar taxi services have been accused of sexually assaulting female passengers. \nAnd many of them have Muslim names. \nTwo Uber drivers \u2013 Hassan Ibrahim, 48, and Salim Salem, 47 \u2013 were charged last week in connection with sexual assaults against female college students at Michigan State University, the Detroit Free Press reported . \nThe two men are accused of using their Uber driver jobs to prey upon college students. \nIbrahim faces one count of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct in connection with a Feb. 14 incident, according to East Lansing police. He turned himself in March 11 after a warrant had been issued for his arrest. \nSalem faces two counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct related to a Jan. 16 incident, and he turned himself in Tuesday. \nBoth were released on $5,000 bail. Salem\u2019s bail includes a condition that he not work as an Uber driver or cab driver in the future. \nEast Lansing police said in late February they were investigating two drivers who allegedly made unwelcome sexual advances toward female MSU students, the Free Press reported. Multiple women complained of inappropriate touching. Hassan Ibrahim, left, and Salim Salem were charged in East Lansing, Michigan \nThe news comes just days after another Uber driver in California \u2013 Omar Mahmoud Mousa, 52, of Anaheim \u2013 was charged with raping a woman at an Anaheim motel, as WND reported . Police said they suspect Mousa likely has other victims and are asking the public to come forward with information. Omar Mahmoud Mousa was charged with raping a 21-year-old female passenger. \nIn another incident reported Feb. 12 by News 4 Jacksonville , Ismael Esa allegedly climbed into the back seat of his car and assaulted a female passenger who was seeking a ride home from her boyfriend\u2019s apartment. \nEsa got into the back seat, locked the doors and started fondling the woman, who was a student at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville. Esa was then accused of stalking his victim, who won a court-ordered injunction against him in January, according to Jacksonville.com . Ismael Esa was charged in Jacksonville, Florida \nDavid Wolf, an attorney representing the Florida woman, said Lyft, like Uber, markets itself as a safe and family friendly service but doesn\u2019t do enough to make sure passengers are safe. \nUber screens potential drivers using a third-party company, which runs automated background checks, according to the company\u2019s policy. \nBut that\u2019s not enough, says Wolf. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing prominently is that advertising without any substance behind the advertising,\u201d he told News 4. \u201cYou do a simple background check that doesn\u2019t mean a person hasn\u2019t been caught. Where is the supervision, where is the accountability, where are the conversations?\u201d \nIn another case in November 2015, Dallas police arrested a 34-year-old Lyft driver for allegedly raping a female passenger. Loai Faheem Laila was charged in Dallas \nPolice found Loai Faheem Laila hiding in his brother\u2019s garage, the Dallas Morning News reported . He was being held in the Dallas County Jail on a $1 million bond because a tipster told police that Laila intended to flee the country. \nThe victim told police she had been at a bar in Dallas and became separated from her friend around 3 a.m. Nov. 7 in the 2900 block of McKinney Avenue. \nShe told police she ordered a ride from an app-based service and she was picked up by a man in a black Chevrolet Tahoe. \nAfter a short distance, Laila allegedly began to inappropriately touch the woman. She resisted, and he pulled onto a \u201cdark side street,\u201d where he raped her in the back of the Tahoe, police said in court records. \nLocal media, cops cover up backgrounds of immigrants \nAlmost never do the police or local media provide background details on these predator drivers such as their immigration status or country of origin. \nOne exception was the case of Philadelphia Uber driver Abdellah Elkaddi. In June last year Elkaddi was accused of raping a 24-year-old woman who had called for a late-night ride home. Abdellah Elkaddi was charged in Philadelphia \nThe judge in that case set bail at $1 million, and part of the reason for the high bail was that Elkaddi is a native of Morocco who had been a U.S. citizen for seven years, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported . \nElkaddi, 46, was arrested hours after the woman said he attacked her early June 11, according to Philly.com . \nShe fell asleep during the drive home, the woman told police. She woke up to Elkaddi groping and mounting her, Philly.com reported. \n\u201cGet off of me! What are you doing?\u201d she yelled seven or eight times as he raped her, according to court documents. \nWatch accused rapist Abdellah Elkaddi being escorted into jail: \nSeveral states are considering legislation to regulate app-based shuttle services. \nA bill in Massachusetts, for example, calls for Uber and Lyft drivers to be fingerprinted and their prints submitted for state and national criminal checks. \nBut the problem predates the advent of Uber and Lyft. \nThe Minneapolis-St. Paul area, home to America's largest Somali refuge community, has had dozens of incidents over the years of Muslim cab drivers being accused of sexually assaulting their female customers. Abdikadir Yusef Mohamed \nOne of the more high-profile cases involved Abdikadir Yusef Mohamed, a 24-year-old St. Paul cab driver brought to the U.S. from Somalia as a refugee. \nAccording to a 2011 report by CBS Minnesota , Mohamed picked up a 27-year-old woman who called for a cab after finishing work on East 6th St. \nThe victim told Mohamed she wanted to smoke, and he told her she could only do so if she moved into the front seat of the cab. When she did, he repeatedly reached up her skirt and touched her genital area. When she resisted him and tried to escape he locked the doors. \nHe responded by saying, \"I know what all you American girls want, let\u2019s go to a parking lot somewhere.\" \nHe ended up being convicted at trial and sentenced to four months in prison and 10 years probation. The victim said she felt intimidated in the courtroom by the numerous Somali family members who came in support of her attacker, a statement Mohamed's attorney called \"racist,\" the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported . \nIn the California case reported last week, police believe there may be more victims and are asking for the public\u2019s help in finding them. \nOmar Mahmoud Mousa, 52, was arrested on a $100,000 bond and assigned a court date of April 8 to face felony charges of rape, forcible oral copulation and sexual penetration by foreign object. The alleged rape occurred Oct. 25, according to the Orange County District Attorney\u2019s Office, but Mousa had been out of the country until recently. He was arrested March 7 as he disembarked from a plane landing at Los Angeles International Airport. \nAuthorities were not saying what country he had traveled to or whether he was a native-born American, a naturalized citizen or some other status. \nUber issued a statement that read: \u201cUber has a zero-tolerance policy for violent behavior, and our thoughts are with the victim of this atrocious crime. We immediately blocked this individual\u2019s access to the Uber platform upon learning of this incident and actively assisted law enforcement in their investigation.\" \nProsecutors said Mousa was working as a driver for Uber when he picked up a 21-year-old woman and her female friend at their Anaheim motel room and drove them to a bar in Fullerton, the Orange County Register reported. \nMousa gave the women his business card and told them to call him directly when they planned to leave, rather than going through the Uber app, authorities said. \nSeveral hours later, one of the women called Mousa and he gave them a ride back to their motel, helping them into their room, prosecutors said. \nProsecutors said the victim's friend immediately passed out on the bed, and Mousa placed the victim on the same bed as her friend. The woman was intoxicated, prosecutors said, but told Mousa \"no\" multiple times as he raped her before she managed to push him away.",

I also like to shop in markets, where I can buy directly from the producer knowing they will receive the money, without middle men shaving off their percentages. \nIt also has its uses for private transactions, for which there are many possible reasons, and by no means all of them illegal. Small businesses starting out need the cash economy. Poor people need the cash economy. The war on cash is a war on them. \nIf you listen to the scaremongering, you\u2019d start to think that all cash users are either criminals, tax evaders or terrorists. Sure, some use cash to evade tax, but it\u2019s paltry compared to the tax avoidance schemes Google and Facebook have employed. Google doesn\u2019t use cash to avoid tax. It\u2019s all done via legislative means. \nCash means total financial inclusion, a luxury the better-off take for granted. Without financial inclusion \u2013 and there will always be some who, for whatever reason, won\u2019t have it \u2013 you are trapped in poverty. So beware the war on cash.",
