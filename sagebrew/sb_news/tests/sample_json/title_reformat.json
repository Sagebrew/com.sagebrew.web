    "text": "For AIPAC , it is crucial to appeal across the political spectrum. But Israel has become an increasingly divisive issue with the public. Credit Illustration by Matt Dorfman On July 23rd, officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2014the powerful lobbying group known as AIPAC\u2014gathered in a conference room at the Capitol for a closed meeting with a dozen Democratic senators. The agenda of the meeting, which was attended by other Jewish leaders as well, was the war in the Gaza Strip. In the century-long conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the previous two weeks had been particularly harrowing. In Israeli towns and cities, families heard sirens warning of incoming rockets and raced to shelters. In Gaza, there were scenes of utter devastation, with hundreds of Palestinian children dead from bombing and mortar fire. The Israeli government claimed that it had taken extraordinary measures to minimize civilian casualties, but the United Nations was launching an inquiry into possible war crimes. Even before the fighting escalated, the United States, Israel\u2019s closest ally, had made little secret of its frustration with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cHow will it have peace if it is unwilling to delineate a border, end the occupation, and allow for Palestinian sovereignty, security, and dignity?\u201d Philip Gordon, the White House co\u00f6rdinator for the Middle East, said in early July. \u201cIt cannot maintain military control of another people indefinitely. Doing so is not only wrong but a recipe for resentment and recurring instability.\u201d Although the Administration repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Israel, it was clearly uncomfortable with the scale of Israel\u2019s aggression. AIPAC did not share this unease; it endorsed a Senate resolution in support of Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend its citizens,\u201d which had seventy-nine co-sponsors and passed without a word of dissent. AIPAC is prideful about its influence. Its promotional literature points out that a reception during its annual policy conference, in Washington, \u201cwill be attended by more members of Congress than almost any other event, except for a joint session of Congress or a State of the Union address.\u201d A former AIPAC executive, Steven Rosen, was fond of telling people that he could take out a napkin at any Senate hangout and get signatures of support for one issue or another from scores of senators. AIPAC has more than a hundred thousand members, a network of seventeen regional offices, and a vast pool of donors. The lobby does not raise funds directly. Its members do, and the amount of money they channel to political candidates is difficult to track. But everybody in Congress recognizes its influence in elections, and the effect is evident. In 2011, when the Palestinians announced that they would petition the U.N. for statehood, AIPAC helped persuade four hundred and forty-six members of Congress to co-sponsor resolutions opposing the idea. During the Gaza conflict, AIPAC has made a priority of sending a message of bipartisan congressional support for all of Israel\u2019s actions. Pro-Israel resolutions passed by unanimous consent carry weight, but not nearly so much as military funding. During the fighting, Israel has relied on the Iron Dome system, a U.S.-funded missile defense that has largely neutralized Hamas\u2019s rockets. Although the U.S. was scheduled to deliver $351 million for the system starting in October, AIPAC wanted more money right away. On July 22nd, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had sent a letter to Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, seeking an immediate payment of $225 million. In the conference room, the senators sat on one side of a long table, the Jewish leaders on the other. Robert Cohen, the president of AIPAC, justified Israel\u2019s assault, agreeing with Netanyahu that Hamas was ultimately responsible for the deaths of its own citizens. At one point, Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, asked about conservative trends in Israel, a participant recalled. \u201cHe said that he supports Israel, but he\u2019s concerned that Israel is headed toward a one-state solution\u2014and that would be so damaging and dangerous for everyone involved.\u201d Charles Schumer, the senior Democrat from New York, interrupted. Turning to address the room, he said, \u201cIt troubles me when I hear people equate Israel and Hamas. That\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s terrible!\u201d Kaine protested, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Cohen simply repeated that Hamas was to blame for everything that was happening. The Senate, preparing for its August recess, hastened to vote on the Iron Dome funding. At first, the appropriation was bundled into an emergency bill that also included money to address the underage refugees flooding across the Mexican border. But, with only a few days left before the break began, that bill got mired in a partisan fight. Reid tried to package Iron Dome with money for fighting wildfires, and then offered it by itself; both efforts failed, stopped largely by budget hawks. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get it done the night before recess, you bemoan the fact that you couldn\u2019t get it done, and everybody goes home,\u201d a congressional staffer said. Instead, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, the Republican leader, decided to stay over, even if it meant missing an event at home. The next morning, with the halls of the Senate all but empty, an unusual session was convened so that McConnell and Reid could try again to pass the bill; Tim Kaine was also there, along with the Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham. \u201cThere were five senators present and literally no one else!\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThey reintroduced it and passed it. This was one of the more amazing feats, for AIPAC.\u201d In a press conference, Graham, who has been a major recipient of campaign contributions connected to AIPAC, pointed out that the funding for Iron Dome was intended as a gesture of solidarity with Israel. \u201cNot only are we going to give you more missiles\u2014we\u2019re going to be a better friend,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for you in the international court of public opinion. We\u2019re going to fight for you in the United Nations.\u201d The influence of AIPAC, like that of the lobbies for firearms, banking, defense, and energy interests, has long been a feature of politics in Washington, particularly on Capitol Hill. But that influence, like the community that AIPAC intends to represent, is not static. For decades, AIPAC has thrived on bipartisanship, exerting its influence on congressional Democrats and Republicans alike. But Israel\u2019s government, now dominated by a coalition of right-wing parties led by Likud, has made compromise far less likely than it was a generation ago. Prime Minister Netanyahu, the leader of Likud and an unabashed partisan of the Republican view of the world, took office at about the same time as President Obama, and the two have clashed frequently over the expansion of Israeli settlements and the contours of a potential peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Although both men repeatedly speak of the unshakable bond between the U.S. and Israel, their relationship has been fraught from the start. In 2012, Netanyahu made little secret of the fact that he hoped Mitt Romney would win the election. Time and again\u2014over issues ranging from Iran to the Palestinians\u2014AIPAC has sided strongly with Netanyahu against Obama. Buy a cartoon AIPAC\u2019s spokesman, Marshall Wittmann, said that the lobby had no loyalty to any political party, in Israel or in the U.S., and that to suggest otherwise was a \u201cmalicious mischaracterization.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cwe are a bipartisan organization of Americans who exercise our constitutional right to lobby the government.\u201d For AIPAC, whose stated mission is to improve relations between the U.S. and Israel, it is crucial to appeal across the political spectrum. In recent years, though, Israel has become an increasingly divisive issue among the American public. Support for Israel among Republicans is at seventy-three per cent, and at forty-four per cent among Democrats, according to a poll conducted in July by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press; the divide is even greater between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. This difference represents a schism among American Jews\u2014AIPAC\u2019s vital core. For decades, the Jewish community was generally united in its support for Israel. Today, a growing number of American Jews, though still devoted to Israel, struggle with the lack of progress toward peace with the Palestinians. Many feel that AIPAC does not speak for them. The Pew Center\u2019s survey found that only thirty-eight per cent of American Jews believe that the Israeli government is sincerely pursuing peace; forty-four per cent believe that the construction of new settlements damages Israel\u2019s national security. In a Gallup poll in late July, only a quarter of Americans under the age of thirty thought that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were justified. As Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the executive director of the left-leaning T\u2019ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, told me, \u201cMany people I know in their twenties and thirties say, I have a perfectly good Jewish life here\u2014why do I need to worry about this country in the Middle East where they\u2019re not representing who I am as a Jew? I\u2019m not proud of what\u2019s happening there. I\u2019m certainly not going to send money. \u201d This is precisely the kind of ambivalence that AIPAC adherents describe as destructive. And yet even Israeli politicians recognize that AIPAC faces a shifting landscape of opinion. Shimon Peres, who served as Prime Minister and, most recently, as President, says, \u201cMy impression is that AIPAC is weaker among the younger people. It has a solid majority of people of a certain age, but it\u2019s not the same among younger people.\u201d For AIPAC, the tension with the Obama Administration over Gaza comes amid a long series of conflicts. Perhaps the most significant of these is over the question of Iran\u2019s obtaining a nuclear weapon. Last October, Iran and the consortium of world powers known as P5+1\u2014Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United States\u2014met in Geneva to begin talks. For two decades, AIPAC has been warning that if Iran acquired nuclear arms it would pose an existential threat to Israel, which has had a nuclear capacity since the late sixties. Netanyahu has insisted that the United States\u2014or Israel alone, if necessary\u2014must be prepared to take military action against Iran. The Obama Administration, too, has said that a nuclear Iran is unthinkable and that \u201call options\u201d\u2014including military options\u2014\u201care on the table.\u201d But Netanyahu fears that Obama is prepared to settle for too little in the negotiations, and, when they began, he launched an uninhibited campaign of public diplomacy against them. In early November, after meeting in Jerusalem with Secretary of State John Kerry, he proclaimed a tentative proposal \u201ca very, very bad deal. It is the deal of the century for Iran.\u201d A photo op for the two men was abruptly cancelled, and Kerry returned to Switzerland. Later that month, Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., met with a bipartisan group of two dozen congressmen in the offices of John Boehner, the House Speaker. Dermer, who comes from a political family in Miami, worked in the nineties for the Republican consultant Frank Luntz as he shaped Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract with America campaign. A few years later, Dermer emigrated to Israel, where he worked as a political consultant and wrote columns for the Jerusalem Post, a conservative daily, in which he referred to Jews who denounced the occupation as \u201cself-haters.\u201d When Netanyahu took office in 2009, he brought in Dermer as a top adviser, and the two became virtually inseparable. \u201cWhenever we met with Bibi in the last several years, Dermer was there,\u201d a former congressional aide said. \u201cHe was like Bibi\u2019s Mini-Me.\u201d In Boehner\u2019s offices, a senior Democrat recalled, \u201cDermer was very critical of the proposed Iran nuclear agreement. He talked about how Reagan would never have done anything like this.\u201d Finally, one of the other politicians in the room had to advise him, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about what Reagan would do. He\u2019s not very popular with Democrats.\u201d The great incentive that the P5+1 could offer Iran was to reduce the sanctions that have crippled its economy. As the talks proceeded, though, Israel\u2019s supporters in Congress were talking about legislation that would instead toughen the sanctions. Dermer didn\u2019t say specifically that he favored such a law\u2014representatives of foreign governments customarily do not advocate for specific U.S. legislation\u2014but it was clear that that was what he and the Israeli leadership wanted. A former congressional staff member who attended the meeting said, \u201cThe implicit critique was the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the President.\u201d Obama\u2019s aides were alarmed by the possibility that AIPAC might endorse new sanctions legislation. They invited Howard Kohr, the group\u2019s chief executive officer, and officials from other prominent Jewish organizations to briefings at the White House. Members of the Administration\u2019s negotiating team, together with State Department officials, walked them through the issues. \u201cWe said, \u2018We know you guys are going to take a tough line on these negotiations, but stay inside the tent and work with us,\u2019 \u201d a senior Administration official recalled. \u201cWe told them directly that a sanctions bill would blow up the negotiations\u2014the Iranians would walk away from the table. They said, \u2018This bill is to strengthen your hand in diplomacy.\u2019 We kept saying, \u2018It doesn\u2019t strengthen our hand in diplomacy. Why do you know better than we do what strengthens our hand? Nobody involved in the diplomacy thinks that. \u2019 \u201d In late November, the negotiators announced an interim Joint Plan of Action. For a period of six months, Iran and the six world powers would work toward a comprehensive solution; in the meantime, Iran would limit its nuclear energy program in exchange for initial relief from sanctions. Netanyahu blasted the agreement, calling it a \u201chistoric mistake,\u201d and, within a few days, the leadership of AIPAC committed itself to fighting for new sanctions. A senior Democrat close to AIPAC described to me the intimate interplay between Netanyahu\u2019s circle and the lobby. \u201cThere are people in AIPAC who believe that it should be an arm of the Likud, an arm of the Republican Party,\u201d he said. Wittmann, the lobby\u2019s spokesman, disputed this, saying, \u201cAIPAC does not take any orders or direction from any foreign principal, in Israel or elsewhere.\u201d For the Israeli leadership and many of its advocates, the Iran negotiations presented an especially vexing problem of political triangulation. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran\u2019s previous President, had been a kind of ideal adversary, attracting widespread outrage by questioning whether the Holocaust had taken place and by challenging Israel\u2019s right to exist. Danny Ayalon, a former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., once described Ahmadinejad\u2019s hateful rhetoric to me as \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving.\u201d But Iran\u2019s new President, Hassan Rouhani, was carefully presenting himself as a relative moderate. Netanyahu would have none of it, calling Rouhani \u201ca wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d \u201cI come from a hundred years in the future to warn you that nothing really changes in the next hundred years.\u201d Buy a cartoon AIPAC worked to mobilize its friends in Congress. Mark Kirk, a Republican senator from Illinois and a major beneficiary of AIPAC-related funding, began pressing to pass a new sanctions bill. \u201cHe was saying, \u2018We\u2019re in negotiations with a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing!\u2019 \u201d a former Senate aide recalled. The bill, co-sponsored by Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, was drafted with considerable input from AIPAC. This was the first time in decades that the lobby had challenged the sitting U.S. President so overtly. The Obama Administration was furious. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to disagree on some aspect of the peace process, on things that are tough for Israel to do,\u201d the senior Administration official told me. \u201cBut this is American foreign policy that they were seeking to essentially derail. There was no other logic to it than ending the negotiations, and the gravity of that was shocking.\u201d AIPAC was incorporated in 1963, fifteen years after the State of Israel came into being. Its leader, Isaiah (Si) Kenen, had been a lobbyist for American Zionist organizations and an employee of Israel\u2019s Office of Information at the United Nations. In that job, Kenen had been obligated to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which had stringent disclosure requirements about financial expenditures and communications with the U.S. government. The journalist M. J. Rosenberg, who volunteered at AIPAC in 1973 and is now a critic of it, recalled Kenen\u2019s saying that the foreign-agent model was too restrictive. AIPAC would lobby Congress for aid to Israel, but its members would be Americans, taking orders from an American board of directors. Rosenberg told me that Kenen was \u201can old-fashioned liberal\u201d who liked to say, \u201cAIPAC has no enemies, only friends and potential friends.\u201d When asked which politicians he hoped to elect, he said, \u201cWe play with the hand that is dealt us.\u201d Congress must lead, he said, and \u201cour job is to help it lead.\u201d Kenen retired in 1974, and by the late eighties AIPAC\u2019s board had come to be dominated by a group of wealthy Jewish businessmen known as the Gang of Four: Mayer (Bubba) Mitchell, Edward Levy, Jr., Robert Asher, and Larry Weinberg. Weinberg was a Democrat who gradually moved to the right. The others were Republicans. In 1980, AIPAC hired Thomas Dine, a former diplomat and congressional staffer, as its executive director. Dine set out to develop a nationwide network that would enable AIPAC to influence every member of Congress. This was a daunting challenge. Jews made up less than three per cent of the American population, concentrated in nine states, and they voted overwhelmingly Democratic. How could AIPAC, with such a small base, become a political force in both parties and in every state? Dine launched a grass-roots campaign, sending young staff members around the country to search for Jews in states where there were few. In Lubbock, Texas, for instance, they found nine who were willing to meet\u2014a tiny group who cared deeply about Israel but never thought that they could play a political role. The lobby created four hundred and thirty-five \u201ccongressional caucuses,\u201d groups of activists who would meet with their member of Congress to talk about the pro-Israel agenda. Dine decided that \u201cif you wanted to have influence you had to be a fund-raiser.\u201d Despite its name, AIPAC is not a political-action committee, and therefore cannot contribute to campaigns. But in the eighties, as campaign-finance laws changed and PACs proliferated, AIPAC helped form pro-Israel PACs. By the end of the decade, there were dozens. Most had generic-sounding names, like Heartland Political Action Committee, and they formed a loose constellation around AIPAC. Though there was no formal relationship, in many cases the leader was an AIPAC member, and as the PACs raised funds they looked to the broader organization for direction. Members\u2019 contributions were often bundled. \u201cAIPAC will select some dentist in Boise, say, to be the bundler,\u201d a former longtime AIPAC member said. \u201cThey tell people in New York and other cities to send their five-thousand-dollar checks to him. But AIPAC has to teach people discipline\u2014because all those people who are giving five thousand dollars would ordinarily want recognition. The purpose is to make the dentist into a big shot\u2014he\u2019s the one who has all this money to give to the congressman\u2019s campaign.\u201d AIPAC representatives tried to match each member of Congress with a contact who shared the congressman\u2019s interests. If a member of Congress rode a Harley-Davidson, AIPAC found a contact who did, too. The goal was to develop people who could get a member of Congress on the phone at a moment\u2019s notice. That persistence and persuasion paid off. Howard Berman, a former congressman from California, recalled that Bubba Mitchell became friends with Sonny Callahan, a fellow-resident of Mobile, Alabama, when Callahan ran for Congress in 1984. Eventually, Callahan became chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. \u201cSonny had always been against foreign aid,\u201d Berman said. \u201cThen he voted for it!\u201d Republicans knew that they would never get more than a minority of the Jewish electorate, but AIPAC members convinced them that voting the right way would lead to campaign contributions. It was a winning argument. In 1984, Mitch McConnell narrowly beat AIPAC supporters\u2019 preferred candidate, the incumbent Democrat Walter Huddleston. Afterward, McConnell met with two AIPAC officials and said to them, \u201cLet me be very clear. What do I need to do to make sure that the next time around I get the community support?\u201d AIPAC members let Republicans know that, if they supported AIPAC positions, the lobby would view them as \u201cfriendly incumbents,\u201d and would not abandon them for a Democratic challenger. The Connecticut Republican senator Lowell Weicker voted consistently with AIPAC; in 1988, he was challenged by the Democrat Joe Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew. Lieberman won, but Weicker got the majority of funding from Jewish donors. In the early days, Howard Berman said, \u201cAIPAC was knocking on an unlocked door.\u201d Most Americans have been favorably disposed toward Israel since its founding, and no other lobby spoke for them on a national scale. Unlike other lobbies\u2014such as the N.R.A., which is opposed by various anti-gun groups\u2014AIPAC did not face a significant and well-funded countervailing force. It also had the resources to finance an expensive and emotionally charged form of persuasion. Dine estimated that in the eighties and nineties contributions from AIPAC members often constituted roughly ten to fifteen per cent of a typical congressional campaign budget. AIPAC provided lavish trips to Israel for legislators and other opinion-makers. Nevertheless, the lobby did not endorse or rank candidates. \u201cWe made the decision to be one step removed,\u201d Dine said. \u201cOrrin Hatch once said, \u2018Dine, your genius is to play an invisible bass drum, and the Jews hear it when you play it.\u2019 \u201d In 1982, after an Illinois congressman named Paul Findley described himself as \u201cYasir Arafat\u2019s best friend in Congress,\u201d AIPAC members encouraged Dick Durbin, a political unknown, to run against him. Robert Asher, a Chicago businessman, sent out scores of letters to his friends, along with Durbin\u2019s position paper on Israel, asking them to send checks. Durbin won, and he is now the Senate Majority Whip. (Findley later wrote a book that made extravagant claims about the power of the Israel lobby.) In 1984, AIPAC affiliates decided that Senator Charles Percy, an Illinois Republican, was unfriendly to Israel. In the next election, Paul Simon, a liberal Democrat, won Percy\u2019s seat. Dine said at the time, \u201cJews in America, from coast to coast, gathered to oust Percy. And American politicians\u2014those who hold public positions now, and those who aspire\u2014got the message.\u201d \u201cFor a militia, he\u2019s not very well regulated.\u201d Buy a cartoon As AIPAC grew, its leaders began to conceive of their mission as something more than winning support and aid for Israel. The Gang of Four, a former AIPAC official noted, \u201ccreated an interesting mantra that they honestly believed: that, if AIPAC had existed prior to the Second World War, America would have stopped Hitler. It\u2019s a great motivator, and a great fund-raiser\u2014but I think it\u2019s also AIPAC\u2019s greatest weakness. Because if you convince yourself that, if only you had been around, six million Jews would not have been killed, then you sort of lose sight of the fact that the U.S. has its own foreign policy, and, while it is extremely friendly to Israel, it will only go so far.\u201d In the fall of 1991, President George H. W. Bush decided to delay ten billion dollars in loan guarantees to Israel, largely because of the continuing expansion of settlements. In response, AIPAC sent activists to Capitol Hill. The lobby was confident. Its officials had told Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli Prime Minister at the time, that Bush did not have the political desire to take on AIPAC, according to a memoir by former Secretary of State James Baker. But Bush proved willing to fight. The former AIPAC official recalled that Bubba Mitchell was summoned to the White House for a meeting: \u201cWhen he came back to the AIPAC boardroom, an hour after the meeting, he was still shaking\u2014because the President of the United States yelled at him!\u201d Soon afterward, Bush remarked that he was \u201cone lonely little guy\u201d fighting \u201csomething like a thousand lobbyists.\u201d The Senate lined up behind him, and voted to postpone consideration of the loan guarantees. For AIPAC, this marked the beginning of a difficult period. The next June, Israeli voters ousted Shamir and his Likud Party and voted in Labor, headed by Yitzhak Rabin. After a career of military campaigns and cautious politics, Rabin began a transformation, offering to scale back settlement activity. In response, Bush asked Congress to approve the loan guarantees. Afterward, Rabin admonished the leaders of AIPAC, telling them that they had done more harm than good by waging battles \u201cthat were lost in advance.\u201d Daniel Kurtzer, then the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told me, \u201cRabin was furious with AIPAC. He felt they were allied with Likud and would undermine him in what he was trying to do.\u201d In September, 1993, Rabin and Arafat signed the Oslo Accords, which were aimed at building a formal peace process with the Palestine Liberation Organization. AIPAC officially endorsed the agreement, and still does. But many members were uncomfortable with it, according to Keith Weissman, a former analyst for the lobby. \u201cAIPAC couldn\u2019t act like they were rejecting what the government of Israel did, but the outcry in the organization about Oslo was so great that they found ways to sabotage it,\u201d he said. (In 2005, Weissman was indicted, along with Steven Rosen, for conspiring to pass national-defense information to a reporter and an Israeli government agent, and AIPAC fired them. The charges were ultimately dropped.) As part of the agreement, the U.S. was to make funds available to the Palestinians, Weissman said. \u201cThe Israelis wanted the money to go to Arafat, for what they called \u2018walking-around money.\u2019 But AIPAC supported a bill in Congress to make sure that the money was never given directly to Arafat and his people, and to monitor closely what was done with it. And, because I knew Arabic, they had me following all of Arafat\u2019s speeches. Was he saying one thing here, and another thing there? Our department became P.L.O. compliance-watchers. The idea was to cripple Oslo.\u201d In 1995, AIPAC encouraged Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House, to support bipartisan legislation to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This put Rabin in a political corner. On one hand, he knew that such a move would infuriate the Arab world and endanger the Oslo process. On the other, as Yossi Beilin, then an official in the Labor government, pointed out, \u201cYou are the Prime Minister of Israel and you are telling American Jews, \u2018Don\u2019t ask for recognition of Jerusalem as our capital\u2019? Nobody can do that!\u201d At a dinner with AIPAC leaders, Rabin told them that he did not support the bill; they continued to promote it nonetheless. In October, the bill passed in Congress, by an overwhelming majority. President Bill Clinton invoked a national-security waiver to prevent its enactment, and so has every President since. In 1999, Ehud Barak, also of the Labor Party, became Prime Minister, and, as Rabin had, he grew friendly with Clinton. \u201cAIPAC flourishes when there is tension between Israel and the U.S., because then they have a role to play,\u201d Gadi Baltiansky, who was Barak\u2019s press spokesman, told me. \u201cBut the relations between Rabin and Clinton, and then Barak and Clinton, were so good that AIPAC was not needed. Barak gave them courtesy meetings. He just didn\u2019t see them as real players.\u201d Still, the lobby maintained its sway in Congress. In 2000, Barak sent Beilin, who was then the Justice Minister, to obtain money that Clinton had promised Israel but never released. Beilin went to see Sandy Berger, Clinton\u2019s national-security adviser. \u201cHe said this money is tied to two hundred and twenty-five million dollars in assistance to Egypt,\u201d Beilin recalled. \u201cWe cannot disburse the money to Israel unless we do to Egypt, so we need to convince Congress to support the whole package. I said, \u2018I am speaking on behalf of my Prime Minister. We want Egypt to get the money.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yossi, this is really wonderful. Do you know somebody in AIPAC?\u2019 \u201d Beilin was astonished: \u201cIt was kind of Kafka\u2014the U.S. national-security adviser is asking the Minister of Justice in Israel whether he knows somebody at AIPAC!\u201d He went to see Howard Kohr, the AIPAC C.E.O., a onetime employee of the Republican Jewish Coalition whom a former U.S. government official described to me as \u201ca comfortable Likudnik.\u201d Kohr told Beilin that it was impossible to allow Egypt to get the money. \u201cYou may think it was wrong for Israel to vote for Barak as Prime Minister\u2014fine,\u201d Beilin recalled saying. \u201cBut do you really believe that you represent Israel more than all of us?\u201d By the end of Barak\u2019s term, in 2001, the money had not been released, to Israel or to Egypt. \u201cThey always want to punish the Arabs,\u201d Beilin concluded. \u201cThey are a very rightist organization, which doesn\u2019t represent the majority of Jews in America, who are so Democratic and liberal. They want to protect Israel from itself\u2014especially when moderate people are Israel\u2019s leaders.\u201d In the spring of 2008, AIPAC moved from cramped quarters on Capitol Hill to a gleaming new seven-story building on H Street, downtown. At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Howard Kohr introduced Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate who had been a generous donor to AIPAC since the nineties, and who had helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel (paying only for Republican members). On this bright spring day, according to someone who was in the audience, Adelson recalled that Kohr had telephoned him, asking him to have lunch. Adelson remembered wondering, How much is this lunch going to cost me? Well, he went on, it cost him ten million dollars: the building was the result. He later told his wife that Kohr should have asked him for fifty million. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to join the Sea Level Club, either.\u201d Buy a cartoon Netanyahu became Prime Minister the following year. AIPAC officials had been close to him since the eighties, when he worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, and stuck with him when, in 1990, he was banned from the State Department for saying that U.S. policy was built \u201con a foundation of distortion and lies.\u201d As Prime Minister, Netanyahu had a difficult relationship with Bill Clinton, largely because Clinton found him unwilling to stop the expansion of settlements and to meaningfully advance the peace process\u2014a sharp contrast with the approach of Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995. Then as now, Netanyahu displayed a vivid sense of his own historical importance, as well as flashes of disdain for the American President. After their first meeting, Clinton sent a message to another Israeli, wryly complaining that he had emerged uncertain who, exactly, was the President of a superpower. But, even if Netanyahu had trouble with the executive branch, AIPAC could help deliver the support of Congress, and a friendly Congress could take away the President\u2019s strongest negotiating chit\u2014the multibillion-dollar packages of military aid that go to Israel each year. The same dynamic was repeated during Barack Obama\u2019s first term. Israeli conservatives were wary, sensing that Obama, in their terms, was a leftist, sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. They took note when, during the 2008 campaign, Obama said, \u201cI think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you\u2019re opposed to Israel, that you\u2019re anti-Israel, and that can\u2019t be the measure of our friendship with Israel.\u201d At Obama\u2019s first meeting with Netanyahu, in May, 2009, Dermer came along, and found himself unable to observe the well-established protocol that one does not interrupt the President. As Obama spoke, Dermer\u2019s hand shot up: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. President, I beg to differ!\u201d Obama demanded a full settlement freeze, as a means of convincing the Palestinians that Netanyahu was not merely stalling the Americans. Netanyahu was incensed, and AIPAC rallied members of Congress to protest. At an AIPAC conference, Dermer declared that Netanyahu would chart his own course with the Palestinians: \u201cThe days of continuing down the same path of weakness and capitulation and concessions, hoping\u2014hoping\u2014that somehow the Palestinians would respond in kind, are over.\u201d Applause swept the room. In a speech at Bar-Ilan University, in June, 2009, Netanyahu seemed to endorse a two-state solution, if in rather guarded terms. Leaders of the settler movement and even many of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud allies were furious at this seemingly historic shift for the Party, though, with time, many of them interpreted the speech as a tactical sop to the United States. No less significant, perhaps, Netanyahu introduced a condition that could make a final resolution impossible\u2014the demand that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state. \u201cIt was a stroke of political brilliance,\u201d the former Senate aide, who had worked closely with Dermer, told me. \u201cHe managed to take the two-state issue off the table and put it back on the Palestinians.\u201d In March, 2010, while Vice-President Joe Biden was visiting Israel, the Netanyahu government announced that it was building sixteen hundred new housing units for Jews in Ramat Shlomo, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Biden said that the move \u201cundermines the trust we need right now.\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Netanyahu to upbraid him. But, while Obama and his team viewed the move as a political insult and yet another blow to a potential two-state solution, AIPAC went into defensive mode, sending an e-mail to its members saying that the Administration\u2019s criticisms of Israel were \u201ca matter of serious concern.\u201d Soon afterward, a letter circulated in the House calling on the Obama Administration to \u201creinforce\u201d the relationship. Three hundred and twenty-seven House members signed it. A couple of months later, when the U.S. tried to extend a partial moratorium on construction in settlements in the West Bank, AIPAC fought against the extension. Obama eventually yielded. In May, 2011, Obama gave a speech about the Arab Spring, and, hoping to break the stalemate in the peace talks, he said, \u201cThe borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps.\u201d The 1967 borders, with some adjustments, had long been recognized as the foundation for a peace agreement, but Obama was the first President to utter the words so explicitly. The next day, Netanyahu arrived in Washington and rebuked him in the Oval Office, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to those indefensible lines.\u201d A veteran Israeli politician was aghast at Netanyahu\u2019s performance. \u201cThis is the President of the United States of America, and you are the head of a client state\u2014let\u2019s not forget that!\u201d he said. \u201cAIPAC should have come to Bibi and said, \u2018You don\u2019t talk to the President the way you do! This is not done, you have to stop it!\u2019 Instead of reflecting almost automatically everything the Israeli government is doing and pushing in that direction.\u201d AIPAC officially supports a two-state solution, but many of its members, and many of the speakers at its conferences, loudly oppose such an agreement. Tom Dine has said that the lobby\u2019s tacit position is \u201cWe\u2019ll work against it until it happens.\u201d After Obama endorsed the 1967 borders, AIPAC members called Congress to express outrage. \u201cThey wanted the President to feel the heat from Israel\u2019s friends on the Hill,\u201d a former Israeli official recalled. \u201cThey were saying to the Administration, \u2018You must rephrase, you must correct!\u2019 \u201d When Obama appeared at an AIPAC policy conference three days later, he was conciliatory: \u201cThe parties themselves\u2014Israelis and Palestinians\u2014will negotiate a border that is different than the one that existed on June 4, 1967. That\u2019s what \u2018mutually agreed-upon swaps\u2019 means.\u201d AIPAC had e-mailed videos to attendees, urging them not to boo the President; they complied, offering occasional wan applause. The next day, Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress and received twenty-nine standing ovations. Fifty years ago, before Israel became an undeclared nuclear power and its existence was under threat, any differences it had with the U.S. were usually aired in private. Today, the political dynamics in both countries\u2014and the particulars of the relationship\u2014have evolved. A majority of Israelis still favor the idea of a two-state solution, but the political mood has shifted markedly to the right. The reasons range from the deeply felt notion that the Palestinians were \u201coffered the world and rejected it\u201d to the rise of Hamas in Gaza, from the aftershock of terror attacks a decade ago to the instability throughout the Middle East. Likud has rejected relative moderates like Dan Meridor and Benny Begin; Netanyahu himself is considered a \u201cdove\u201d by some leaders of his coalition and members of his party. The consensus deepens that Oslo was a failure, and that, as Netanyahu says, \u201cthere is no partner for peace.\u201d The Palestinians, for their part, argue that the settlements in the West Bank and Jewish expansion into East Jerusalem have created a \u201cone-state reality.\u201d They point out that members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition reject a two-state solution\u2014\u201cThe land is ours!\u201d\u2014and endorse permanent Israeli control, or outright annexation, of the West Bank. Netanyahu prides himself on understanding the American political climate. But his deepest relationships are with older, often wealthy members of the establishments in New York and Los Angeles, and he is less conscious of the changes in American demographics and in opinion among younger American Jews. Assaf Sharon, the research director of Molad, a progressive think tank in Jerusalem, said, \u201cWhen Israelis see House members jump like springs to applaud every lame comment Bibi utters, they think he is a star in Washington. Then they are told by the local pundits that everything else is just personal friction with Obama. My sense is that the people surrounding Bibi\u2014and the Prime Minister himself\u2014don\u2019t appreciate the significance of the shift.\u201d Buy a cartoon Yet the rhetoric of Netanyahu\u2019s circle has never been more confident. In a recent talk, Dermer argued that Israel is a regional superpower, with much to give in its relationship with the U.S. \u201cAmerica\u2019s most important ally in the twentieth century was Great Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cYour most important ally in the twenty-first century is going to be the State of Israel.\u201d In a meeting with young Likud supporters last spring, which one of them transcribed online, Netanyahu boasted of defying Obama\u2019s pressure to halt settlements; 2013 was a record year for settlement construction in the West Bank. He preferred to \u201cstand up to international pressure by maneuvering,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is that we continue to head straight toward our goal, even if one time we walk right and another time walk left.\u201d When one of the Likudniks asked about peace talks with the Palestinians, Netanyahu is said to have replied, as the audience laughed, \u201cAbout the\u2014what?\u201d AIPAC\u2019s hold on Congress has become institutionalized. Each year, a month or two before the annual policy conference, AIPAC officials tell key members what measures they want, so that their activists have something to lobby for. \u201cEvery year, we create major legislation, so they can justify their existence to their members,\u201d the former congressional aide said. (AIPAC maintains that only members of Congress initiate legislative action.) AIPAC board meetings are held in Washington each month, and directors visit members of Congress. They generally address them by their first names, even if they haven\u2019t met before. The intimacy is presumed, but also, at times, earned; local AIPAC staffers, in the manner of basketball recruiters, befriend some members when they are still serving on the student council. \u201cIf you have a dream about running for office, AIPAC calls you,\u201d one House member said. Certainly, it\u2019s a rarity when someone undertakes a campaign for the House or the Senate today without hearing from AIPAC. In 1996, Brian Baird, a psychologist from Seattle, decided to run for Congress. Local Democrats asked if he had thought about what he was going to say to AIPAC. \u201cI had admired Israel since I was a kid,\u201d Baird told me. \u201cBut I also was fairly sympathetic to peaceful resolution and the Palestinian side. These people said, \u2018We respect that, but let\u2019s talk about the issues and what you might say.\u2019 The difficult reality is this: in order to get elected to Congress, if you\u2019re not independently wealthy, you have to raise a lot of money. And you learn pretty quickly that, if AIPAC is on your side, you can do that. They come to you and say, \u2018We\u2019d be happy to host ten-thousand-dollar fund-raisers for you, and let us help write your annual letter, and please come to this multi-thousand-person dinner.\u2019 \u201d Baird continued, \u201cAny member of Congress knows that AIPAC is associated indirectly with significant amounts of campaign spending if you\u2019re with them, and significant amounts against you if you\u2019re not with them.\u201d For Baird, AIPAC-connected money amounted to about two hundred thousand dollars in each of his races\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s two hundred thousand going your way, versus the other way: a four-hundred-thousand-dollar swing.\u201d The contributions, as with many interest groups, come with a great deal of tactical input. \u201cThe AIPAC people do a very good job of \u2018informing\u2019 you about the issues,\u201d Baird told me. \u201cIt literally gets down to \u2018No, we don\u2019t say it that way, we say it this way.\u2019 Always phrased as a friendly suggestion\u2014but it\u2019s pretty clear you don\u2019t want to say \u2018occupied territories\u2019! There\u2019s a whole complex semantic code you learn. . . . After a while, you find yourself saying and repeating it as if it were fact.\u201d Soon after taking office, Baird went on a \u201cvirtually obligatory\u201d trip to Israel: a freshman ritual in which everything\u2014business-class flights, accommodations at the King David or the Citadel\u2014is paid for by AIPAC\u2019s charitable arm. The tours are carefully curated. \u201cThey do have you meet with the Palestinian leaders, in a sort of token process,\u201d Baird said. \u201cBut then when you\u2019re done with it they tell you everything the Palestinian leaders said that\u2019s wrong. And, of course, the Palestinians don\u2019t get to have dinner with you at the hotel that night.\u201d In early 2009, after a brief truce between Israel and Hamas collapsed in a series of mutual provocations, Israel carried out Operation Cast Lead, an incursion into Gaza in which nearly fourteen hundred Palestinians were killed, along with thirteen Israelis. Baird visited the area a few weeks later and returned several times. As he wrote in an op-ed, he saw \u201cfirsthand the devastating destruction of hospitals, schools, homes, industries, and infrastructure.\u201d That September, the U.N. Human Rights Council issued a report, based on an inquiry led by the South African jurist Richard Goldstone, that accused Israel of a series of possible war crimes. AIPAC attacked the report, saying it was \u201crigged.\u201d A month later, an AIPAC-sponsored resolution to condemn the report was introduced in the House, and three hundred and forty-four members voted in favor. \u201cI read every single word of that report, and it comported with what I had seen and heard on the ground in Gaza,\u201d Baird said. \u201cWhen we had the vote, I said, \u2018We have member after member coming to the floor to vote on a resolution they\u2019ve never read, about a report they\u2019ve never seen, in a place they\u2019ve never been.\u2019 \u201d Goldstone came under such pressure that threats were made to ban him from his grandson\u2019s bar mitzvah at a Johannesburg synagogue. He eventually wrote an op-ed in which he expressed regret for his conclusions, saying, \u201cCivilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy.\u201d Other members of the council stood by the report. In 2010, Baird decided not to run again for the House; he is now the president of Antioch University Seattle. Few current members of Congress are as outspoken about AIPAC as Baird. Staff members fret about whether AIPAC will prevent them from getting a good consulting job when they leave government. \u201cYou just hear the name!\u201d a Senate aide said. \u201cYou hear that they are involved and everyone\u2019s ears perk up and their mood changes, and they start to fall in line in a certain way.\u201d Baird said, \u201cWhen key votes are cast, the question on the House floor, troublingly, is often not \u2018What is the right thing to do for the United States of America?\u2019 but \u2018How is AIPAC going to score this?\u2019 \u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s such a conundrum here, of believing that you\u2019re supporting Israel, when you\u2019re actually backing policies that are antithetical to its highest values and, ultimately, destructive for the country.\u201d In talks with Israeli officials, he found that his inquiries were not treated with much respect. In 2003, one of his constituents, Rachel Corrie, was killed by a bulldozer driven by an Israeli soldier, as she protested the demolition of Palestinians\u2019 homes in Gaza. At first, he said, the officials told him, \u201cThere\u2019s a simple explanation\u2014here are the facts.\u201d Or, \u201cWe will look into it.\u201d But, when he continued to press, something else would emerge. \u201cThere is a disdain for the U.S., and a dismissal of any legitimacy of our right to question\u2014because who are we to talk about moral values?\u201d Baird told me. \u201cWhether it\u2019s that we didn\u2019t help early enough in the Holocaust, or look at what we did to our African-Americans, or our Native Americans\u2014whatever! And they see us, members of Congress, as basically for sale. So they want us to shut up and play the game.\u201d \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t see the big deal about the ice-bucket challenge.\u201d Buy a cartoon In 2007, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, two leading political scientists of the realist school, published a book called \u201cThe Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy.\u201d The book, a best-seller, presented a scathing portrait of AIPAC, arguing that the lobby had a nearly singular distorting influence on American foreign policy, and even that it was a central factor in the rush to war in Iraq. While the authors\u2019 supporters praised their daring, their critics argued that they had neglected to point out any failures of the Palestinian leadership, and painted AIPAC in conspiratorial, omnipotent tones. Even Noam Chomsky, a fierce critic of Israel from the left, wrote that the authors had exaggerated the influence of AIPAC, and that other special interests, like the energy lobby, had greater influence on Middle East policy. A broader political challenge to AIPAC came in 2009, with the founding of J Street, a \u201cpro-Israel, pro-peace\u201d advocacy group. Led by Jeremy Ben-Ami, a former Clinton Administration aide whose grandparents were among the first settlers in Tel Aviv, J Street was founded to appeal to American Jews who strongly support a two-state solution and who see the occupation as a threat to democracy and to Jewish values. J Street has only a tiny fraction of AIPAC\u2019s financial power and influence on Capitol Hill, but it has tried to provide at least some campaign funding to weaken the lobby\u2019s grip. AIPAC and its allies have responded aggressively. This year, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations voted not to admit J Street, because, as the leader of one Orthodox alliance said to the Times, its \u201cpositions are out of the mainstream of what could be considered acceptable within the Jewish community.\u201d Danny Ayalon, the former Israeli Ambassador, told me, \u201cWhen Jewish organizations join the political campaign to delegitimatize Israel, they are really undermining our security collectively. Because I do believe that, if Israel\u2019s security is compromised, so is that of every Jew in the world.\u201d Many Israeli and Palestinian leaders have taken note of the rise of J Street and, without overestimating its capacities, see that it represents an increasing diversity of opinion in the American Jewish community. At the last J Street convention, in Washington, Husam Zomlot, a rising figure in Fatah, the largest faction in the P.L.O., delivered a speech about the Palestinian cause and got a standing ovation. \u201cAIPAC is not as effective as it was,\u201d Zomlot said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say J Street is the mainstream representative of Jewish Americans, but it is a trend that gives you some sense of where things are and what is happening. Though it has limited funding, it is the first organized Jewish group with a different agenda in Washington since Israel was established. It\u2019s worth noticing.\u201d Some politicians in Washington have indeed noticed, and not always to their benefit. Soon after J Street got started, it endorsed Robert Wexler, a Democratic congressman who represented a South Florida district. \u201cSome AIPAC people told me they would not support me anymore if I went to a J Street event or took their support,\u201d Wexler recalled. \u201cI called them and said, \u2018You\u2019ve supported me for twelve years. You\u2019re not going to support me because somebody from J Street endorsed me?\u2019 \u201d Wexler added, \u201cAIPAC is still by a factor of a hundred to one the premier lobbying organization for the Jewish community. I\u2019ll never understand why they care one iota about J Street\u2014but they have this bizarre fixation on it.\u201d Jan Schakowsky, who has represented a liberal Chicago district since 1999, was another of J Street\u2019s first endorsees. For years, she had maintained good relations with AIPAC, whose members * gave money to her campaigns and praised her positions. She voted to condemn the Goldstone report and signed a 2010 letter urging the Administration to keep any differences with Israel private. But in her 2010 race, she was challenged by Joel Pollak, an Orthodox Jew, who argued that she was insufficiently supportive of Israel. \u201cWe were very much aware that AIPAC-associated people were fund-raising for Jan\u2019s opponent,\u201d Dylan Williams, the director of government affairs for J Street, said. A small but vocal contingent of AIPAC members were behind Pollak. But he was also backed by the Tea Party, which J Street believed might drive away other Jewish voters. The new lobby raised seventy-five thousand dollars for Schakowsky (through its PAC, whose financial contributions are publicly disclosed), and she won by a wide margin. \u201cIt was exactly the type of race we had hoped for!\u201d Williams said. \u201cA lot of the power of AIPAC is based on this perception, which I believe is a myth, that if you cross their line you will be targeted, and your opponent in your next race will receive all this money, and it will make a difference.\u201d Still, Schakowsky told me, the process was painful. \u201cGetting booed in a synagogue was not a pleasure,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not just my base\u2014it\u2019s my family!\u201d She added, \u201cIncreasingly, Israel has become a wedge issue, something to be used against the President by the Republicans, and it can be very unhelpful.\u201d AIPAC is still capable of mounting a show of bipartisanship. At this year\u2019s policy conference, Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic Whip, appeared onstage with Eric Cantor, then the Republican House Majority Leader, and together they rhapsodized about the summer trip they routinely took, leading groups of mostly freshmen on an AIPAC tour of Israel. \u201cFew things are as meaningful as watching your colleagues discover the Jewish state for the very first time,\u201d Cantor said. Hoyer offered a benediction: \u201cWe Baptists would say, \u2018Amen.\u2019 \u201d Cantor and Hoyer have been steadfast supporters of AIPAC, and its members have held at least a dozen fund-raisers for them each year. But last December AIPAC\u2019s efforts to implement sanctions against Iran were so intense that even this well-tempered partnership fractured. When Congress returned from its Thanksgiving recess, legislators in the House began discussing a sanctions bill. According to the former congressional aide, Cantor told Hoyer that he wanted a bill that would kill the interim agreement with Iran. Hoyer refused, saying that he would collaborate only on a nonbinding resolution. Cantor sent Hoyer a resolution that called for additional sanctions and sought to define in advance the contours of an agreement with Iran. \u201cThe pressure was tremendous\u2014not just AIPAC leadership and legislative officials but various board members and other contributors, from all over the country,\u201d the former congressional aide recalled. \u201cWhat was striking was how strident the message was,\u201d another aide said. \u201c \u2018How could you not pass a resolution that tells the President what the outcome of the negotiations has to be?\u2019 \u201d Advocates for the sanctions portrayed Obama as feckless. \u201cThey said, \u2018Iranians have been doing this for millennia. They can smell weakness. Why is the President showing weakness?\u2019 \u201d a Senate aide recalled. AIPAC was betting that the Democrats, facing midterms with an unpopular President, would break ranks, and that Obama would be unable to stop them. Its confidence was not unfounded; every time Netanyahu and AIPAC had opposed Obama, he had retreated. But Obama took up the fight with unusual vigor. He has been deeply interested in nonproliferation since his college days, and he has been searching for an opening with Iran since his Presidential campaign in 2008. As the Cantor-Hoyer resolution gathered momentum, House Democrats began holding meetings at the White House to strategize about how to oppose it. \u201cWait\u2014I almost forgot why I called.\u201d April 18, 2005 Buy a cartoon Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the head of the Democratic National Committee, attended the meetings, at some political risk. Wasserman Schultz represents a heavily Jewish district in South Florida, and has been a reliable signature on AIPAC\u2019s letters and resolutions; she has boasted of concurring with a hundred per cent of its positions. Now the lobby e-mailed out an \u201cAIPAC Action Alert,\u201d including the text of a story about the meetings in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, in which she was described as \u201csiding with the Mullahs over the American people.\u201d The alert asked AIPAC\u2019s executive-council members to contact her office, ask if the story was true, and challenge her opposition to Cantor-Hoyer. Stephen Fiske, the chair of the pro-Israel Florida Congressional Committee PAC, sent a similar alert to Wasserman Schultz\u2019s constituents, setting off a cascade of calls to her office. (Fiske told the Free Beacon that the callers included a team of young students: his son\u2019s classmates at a Jewish day school in North Miami Beach.) Wasserman Schultz was furious. Soon afterward, she flew to Israel for the funeral of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. On the trip, she remarked to a colleague, \u201cThey\u2019re doing this to me?\u201d But as the meetings continued Democrats began to build a consensus. In December, Ester Kurz, AIPAC\u2019s director of legislative strategy, went to see Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader, to urge her to pass the resolution. Pelosi resisted, pointing out that many members of Hoyer\u2019s caucus strongly opposed it. David Price, a Democrat, and Charles Dent, a Republican, had written a letter to the President, urging him to use the diplomatic opening that followed Rouhani\u2019s election to attempt a nuclear agreement; it garnered a hundred and thirty-one signatures. Pointing to the letter, Pelosi demanded to know why AIPAC wanted this resolution, at this time. The members of Hoyer\u2019s caucus pressed him, and, on December 12th, just as the language of the resolution became final, he asked to set aside the effort, saying that the time was not right. His demurral\u2014from someone who had rarely disappointed AIPAC\u2014was a sign that the lobby might be in uncharted terrain. Two weeks after local AIPAC activists pressured Wasserman Schultz, a national board member issued a statement that called her \u201ca good friend of Israel and a close friend of AIPAC.\u201d The crucial fight, though, was in the Senate. A couple of days before the Christmas recess, Robert Menendez and Mark Kirk introduced their sanctions bill, the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013. At first, senators were eager to express support\u2014previous Iran-sanctions bills had passed by votes of 99\u20130\u2014and, by the second week of January, Menendez and Kirk had secured the votes of fifty-nine senators, including sixteen Democrats. One more vote would enable the bill\u2019s supporters to overcome a filibuster. A number of senators facing re\u00eblection were told by AIPAC contacts that fund-raisers would be cancelled if they did not sign on, according to several employees of another lobby. (AIPAC denies this.) In January, though, AIPAC\u2019s effort stalled. Some senators complained that the bill called for immediate sanctions. In fact, a close reading of the bill makes plain that most of the sanctions would become active ninety days after enactment. But the sanctions, ostensibly intended to put pressure on the Iranian negotiators, were designed to go into effect automatically, no matter how the nuclear talks went. The bill also dictated to negotiators the acceptable terms of an agreement, and committed the U.S. to support any defensive military action that Israel took against Iran. On the Senate floor, Dianne Feinstein gave a pointed speech, in which she warned that, if the bill passed, \u201cdiplomatic negotiations will collapse,\u201d and said, \u201cWe cannot let Israel determine when and where the United States goes to war.\u201d Ten Senate committee chairmen\u2014including Feinstein, who serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence, and Carl Levin, of Michigan, the head of the Armed Services Committee\u2014wrote to Harry Reid, noting that the intelligence community believed that new sanctions would effectively halt the negotiations. At the same time, AIPAC was urging Reid to bring the measure to a vote\u2014and, as the former congressional aide noted, \u201cyou don\u2019t alienate a key fund-raising base, especially when you may be about to lose the Senate.\u201d But the pressure from the White House was even greater. Brad Gordon, AIPAC\u2019s longtime legislative official, said ruefully, \u201cI have not seen the Administration act with such force and such sustained effort . . . since Obama became President.\u201d At a meeting with several dozen Democratic senators in January, Obama spoke at length about Iran, warning of the possibility of war. Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, said later that the President \u201cwas as good as I\u2019ve ever heard him.\u201d As congressional Democrats continued to meet in the White House Obama\u2019s press secretary, Jay Carney, referred to the proposed sanctions as part of a \u201cmarch to war.\u201d Not long afterward, Bernadette Meehan, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said, \u201cIf certain members of Congress want the United States to take military action, they should be up front with the American public and say so.\u201d Congressional offices were inundated with calls from constituents alarmed by the prospect of war. The decisive moment came in the State of the Union speech, when Obama said plainly, \u201cIf this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.\u201d About a week later, forty-two Republican senators sent a letter to Reid, demanding that he bring Menendez-Kirk to a vote, and noting that he had already \u201ctaken unprecedented steps to take away the rights of the minority in the Senate.\u201d Reid\u2019s staff members urged AIPAC officials to stop pressing for the bill; their office had been open to a bipartisan process, they argued, but siding with the Republicans against Obama was hardly bipartisan. According to a former Senate aide, the lobbyists seemed to realize that if they continued to push they would have to give up any claim to bipartisanship. Two days later, AIPAC issued a statement saying that the time was not right for a vote; Menendez issued a similar statement. \u201cThat was the fundamental moment when Menendez-Kirk lost,\u201d the aide said. AIPAC had sustained a painful defeat\u2014and its annual policy conference was only a few weeks away. The day before the conference, according to a senior House Democrat, \u201cAIPAC still did not have its \u2018ask\u2019 together.\u201d Instead of dictating the terms of legislation, the lobby struggled to negotiate letters to the President, urging him to support sanctions. In the end, Cantor and Hoyer\u2019s resolution was reduced to a letter, circulated in the House, that was so anodyne that most Democrats in the progressive caucus signed it. Some of the House Democrats who had fought against the resolution were enjoying a new sense of confidence. For a month, David Price and his fellow-Democrat Lloyd Doggett had been gathering support for a letter to the President, saying that Congress should \u201cgive diplomacy a chance.\u201d They expected to get perhaps forty signatures. Instead, they got a hundred and four, including those of four Republicans. \u201cAIPAC tried to peel some away, but what\u2019s striking is how few we lost,\u201d Price said. A handful of Jewish members signed, including Jan Schakowsky. Wasserman Schultz did not. \u201cIt was a difficult policy spot for all of us, as Jewish members,\u201d Schakowsky said. But, had the Cantor-Hoyer resolution passed, she continued, \u201cit would have created an atmosphere surrounding the bargaining table that the President could not bargain in good faith. And it would for the first time have dramatically divided the Democrats.\u201d John Yarmuth, of Kentucky, another Jewish member who signed the letter, said, \u201cAIPAC clearly has a great deal of clout in the Republican conference, and many Democrats still think that they have to be responsive to it.\u201d But he believes that the letter was an important measure of congressional restiveness. \u201cI think there is a growing sense among members that things are done just to placate AIPAC, and that AIPAC is not really working to advance what is in the interest of the United States.\u201d He concluded, \u201cWe all took an oath of office. And AIPAC, in many instances, is asking us to ignore it.\u201d A few months later, the Gaza war began, and AIPAC mobilized again. \u201cThere were conference calls, mass e-mails, talking points for the day,\u201d a congressional aide said. \u201cAIPAC activists would e-mail me, with fifteen other AIPAC activists cc\u2019d, and then those people would respond, saying, \u2018I agree entirely with what the first e-mail said!\u2019 \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got those Stuck-in-the-Subway-Listening-to-a-Guy-Massacre-Dylan Blues.\u201d October 25, 2010 Buy a cartoon It didn\u2019t hurt AIPAC\u2019s cause that the enemy was Hamas, whose suicide bombings a decade ago killed hundreds of Israeli civilians, and whose rocket attacks in recent years have terrorized citizens, particularly in southern Israel. As Israel pressed its offensive, and hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed, AIPAC argued, as did Netanyahu, that the casualties came only because Hamas was using human shields. Online, AIPAC posted a short film, \u201cIsrael\u2019s Moral Defense,\u201d which depicted an Israeli major in a quandary. Looking at a schoolyard filled with girls in neat uniforms, he sees fighters with a rocket launcher not far behind them. Should he order his men to fire their machine guns, and risk hitting the girls, or hold back, and risk the rocket killing Israelis? \u201cI didn\u2019t pull the trigger,\u201d the soldier says. \u201cWe are totally different. . . . I am very proud to be in an army that has this level of morality.\u201d A couple of weeks after the film appeared, Israeli shells struck a United Nations school in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing twenty-one people and injuring more than ninety; it was the sixth U.N. school that Israel had bombed. The next day, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, pointed out that, as Israeli forces attacked homes, schools, and hospitals, the U.S. was supplying them with heavy weaponry. Almost simultaneously, the House passed an AIPAC-supported resolution denouncing Hamas\u2019s use of human shields and condemning an inquiry into Israel\u2019s Gaza operations that Pillay was sponsoring. According to congressional staffers, some members of Congress seemed eager to make up for their recent apostasy on the Iran negotiations. While Reid and his colleagues went to extraordinary lengths to fund the Iron Dome missile-defense system, the House leadership engaged in the same mission. The vote in the House came late on the night of Friday, August 1st\u2014the last possible moment before the summer recess. The earlier resolutions that AIPAC had sponsored during the war had passed unanimously, with no record of individual votes, but on this vote the roll was called. (AIPAC sometimes asks congressional leaders to call the roll when a decisive victory seems likely.) \u201cI think AIPAC thought this vote would be one hundred per cent,\u201d Jim Moran, a Democrat from Virginia, said. It was close: out of four hundred and thirty-five members, only eight voted no. Moran, who has been in Congress since 1990, and is retiring this year, was one of four Democrats who voted against the resolution. As a longtime member of the Defense Appropriations Committee, he did not believe that there was any urgent need for the funding. \u201cWe have put about nine hundred million dollars into the Iron Dome,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe know that there are many millions unexpended in Israel\u2019s Iron Dome account. And Israel was to get three hundred and fifty-one million on October 1st, for Iron Dome.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, a freshman Democrat from El Paso, also voted against the funding. \u201cI tried to find him on the floor, but I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Moran said. \u201cI wanted him to switch his vote. Now, he might not have switched it anyway, because\u2014as shocking as it may be\u2014he\u2019s in Congress solely to do what he considers to be the right thing. I\u2019m afraid he may have a tough race in November.\u201d The morning after the vote, O\u2019Rourke e-mailed a local AIPAC activist, Stuart Schwartz, to explain his vote, according to a knowledgeable person. In his explanation, which he also posted on Facebook, he pointed out that he had voted for Iron Dome in the past, and had supported the funds that were scheduled to arrive in October. But, he wrote, \u201cI could not in good conscience vote for borrowing $225 million more to send to Israel, without debate and without discussion, in the midst of a war that has cost more than a thousand civilian lives already, too many of them children.\u201d Within hours, O\u2019Rourke was flooded with e-mails, texts, and calls. The next day, the El Paso Times ran a front-page story with the headline \u201cO\u2019ROURKE VOTE DRAWS CRITICISM.\u201d In the story, Stuart Schwartz, who is described as having donated a thousand dollars to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s previous campaign, commented that O\u2019Rourke \u201cchooses to side with the rocket launchers and terror tunnel builders.\u201d A mass e-mail circulated, reading \u201cThe Following Is Shameful, El Paso Has an Anti-Israel Congressman. . . . Do Not Re\u00eblect Beto O\u2019Rourke.\u201d At the bottom was the address of AIPAC\u2019s Web site, and a snippet of text: \u201cAIPAC is directly responsible for the overwhelming support this legislation received on the Hill. If you are not a member of AIPAC, I strongly recommend that you join. Every dollar helps fund this important work in Congress.\u201d The day that Congress passed the Iron Dome bills happened to be an especially deadly one in Gaza. In the city of Rafah, Israeli troops pursued Hamas fighters with such overwhelming force that about a hundred and fifty Palestinians were killed, many of them women and children. Israel\u2019s critics in the region have been energized. Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator, told me that Congress had sent a clear message by funding Iron Dome that day. \u201cCongress was telling Israel, \u2018You go ahead and kill, and we will fund it for you.\u2019 \u201d She argued that Israelis had dominated American political discourse on the war, as they have for decades on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \u201cThey say, \u2018The Palestinians are all terrorists, they are the people we don\u2019t know, they are alien, foreign, strange\u2014but Israelis are like us.\u2019 Who shaped the presentation, in the U.S.? AIPAC, to a large degree.\u201d Yet the war has broad support in Israel. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, just six per cent of the Jewish population believes that the Israeli Army has used excessive force. Of those who expressed an opinion, almost half believe that the force has not been severe enough. The left, finding itself increasingly isolated, is deeply critical of AIPAC. Zeev Sternhell, a leading Israeli intellectual and an expert on European fascism, told me, \u201cI consider AIPAC\u2019s role to have been absolutely disastrous, because it prevents any possibility to move with the Palestinians. We cannot move without American intervention\u2014but we are more or less free of American intervention. This is AIPAC\u2019s job. So the present coalition has this sentiment of impunity.\u201d In the U.S., the war has created tense disagreement, dividing left and right, young and old. Congress showed no such uncertainty, which is a triumph for AIPAC. But the lobby also faces an inevitable question about the extent to which young liberals like O\u2019Rourke represent the future. When I asked Dore Gold, an external adviser to the Netanyahu government, about AIPAC\u2019s prospects, he spoke in determinedly upbeat tones, dismissing the Iran-sanctions episode. \u201cA political loss does not necessarily mean that a political organization has reached its sunset years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the contrary, it can give added motivation for people who are concerned with the implications of Iran crossing the nuclear threshold.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cwhen issues become so partisan, it is harder for an organization like AIPAC. You have to fight that.\u201d For decades, AIPAC has maintained a hugely successful model, creating widespread support from an unlikely base, and tapping into a seemingly endless wellspring of support from the American Jewish community. But bipartisanship is a relic now, and a generation of unquestioning adherents is aging. Like its embattled allies in Congress, AIPAC needs to reach constituents who represent the country as it will look in the coming decades. At AIPAC\u2019s policy conference last March, Olga Miranda, the president of S.E.I.U. Local 87, gazed out at the crowd that filled the darkened Washington Convention Center\u2014a gathering she dubbed the \u201cJewish Super Bowl.\u201d Large video screens displayed her image. A lively woman with long black hair and a commanding voice, Miranda proclaimed, \u201cI am a union leader, I am Joaquin\u2019s mother, I am one of nine children raised by a single mother, I am a Chicana\u2014and I am AIPAC!\u201d For years, she explained, her information about the Middle East had come from television, and she sympathized with the Palestinians, until one day she got a call from someone at AIPAC who asked her if she\u2019d be interested in a trip to Israel. That trip changed her life, she said. Now she argues about Israel with her friends and colleagues. \u201cSee you on the picket lines!\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a comedy, so I\u2019ve had Steve, here, red-flag the funny parts.\u201d December 22, 2003 Buy a cartoon \u201cThe face of pro-Israel activists has changed pretty dramatically,\u201d David Victor, a former AIPAC president, told me. In the past eight years, AIPAC has reached out to Hispanics, African-Americans, and evangelical Christians, in the hope that greater diversity will translate into continued support in Congress. Victor pointed out that this year\u2019s AIPAC conference was bigger than ever. In 2008, when he was president, eight thousand members attended; this year, there were fourteen thousand, including two hundred and sixty student-government presidents. \u201cThese are future opinion leaders,\u201d he said. Those opinion leaders face a difficult task when they return to campus. Many young American Jews believe that criticism is vital to Israel\u2019s survival as a democratic state. Some are even helping to support a campaign known as B.D.S., for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, which is aimed at ending the occupation and recognizing the rights of Palestinian refugees and citizens. In June, the U.S. branch of the Presbyterian church voted to divest from three companies seen as profiting from the military occupation of the West Bank. (One was Caterpillar, the construction-equipment company, which Rachel Corrie\u2019s parents had sued, unsuccessfully.) The church took care to affirm Israel\u2019s right to exist and to disavow an endorsement of the B.D.S. movement. J Street, likewise, has said that B.D.S. can be \u201ca convenient mantle for thinly disguised anti-Semitism.\u201d But the movement persists, particularly on campuses and in left-wing circles. Ironically, there is also a threat to AIPAC from the right. Many American conservatives were enraged by the perception that AIPAC had surrendered in the fight for Iran sanctions. Shortly after Menendez set aside his efforts to pass the bill, AIPAC issued a statement vowing to try again later. \u201cThey did that because there was an eruption from the other side,\u201d a former Senate aide said. \u201c \u2018How could you sell out the Republican caucus, when we were advocating exactly what Bibi Netanyahu was!\u2019 \u201d Republicans were frustrated by the lobby\u2019s refusal to move forward at the expense of Democrats, the aide said: \u201cI know AIPAC has its commitment to bipartisanship. But what good is that commitment if in the end you don\u2019t achieve your policy objective?\u201d For AIPAC\u2019s most severe conservative critics, its attempts to occupy a diminishing sliver of middle ground are unacceptable. Recently, Sheldon Adelson, who funded AIPAC\u2019s new office building a few years ago, has been increasing his support for the right-wing Zionist Organization of America. Mort Klein, the head of the Z.O.A., told me, \u201cAdelson is not happy with AIPAC, clearly.\u201d Several people affiliated with the right-wing Jewish movement told me that significant donors are talking about founding a new organization. Caught between the increasingly right-leaning Israel and the increasingly fractious United States, AIPAC has little space to maneuver. Wittmann, the spokesman, said, \u201cOur positions in support of the Oslo process and the two-state solution have generated criticism from some on the right, just as our stand for strong prospective Iran sanctions has spurred criticism from some on the left\u201d\u2014a statement of bipartisan intent, but also of the difficulty of contemporary politics. Recently, the lobby has begun another outreach effort, focussed on progressive Democrats. At the conference, Olga Miranda and Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 Presidential campaign, spoke on a panel called \u201cThe Progressive Case for Israel.\u201d Lewis told me that she has recently been involved in conversations with AIPAC staff and board members about finding ways to improve AIPAC\u2019s connections with progressive Democrats. \u201cThey are exploring how to reach progressives, but they\u2019re lost on this!\u201d a leader in the pro-Israel community who is knowledgeable about the effort said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to bridge the gap. People see AIPAC as representing issues that are anathema to them. It\u2019s an enormous challenge.\u201d At the conference, the extent of the challenge was clear. Even Netanyahu seemed struck by the mood. At one point in his speech, he said, \u201cI hope that the Palestinian leadership will stand with Israel and the United States on the right side of the moral divide, the side of peace, reconciliation, and hope.\u201d The audience members responded with scant, listless applause. \u201cYou can clap,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u2666 * An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Jan Schakowsky\u2019s campaigns received funding from the AIPAC organization.

    "text": "Global \n\u201cIt is perfectly true, as the philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition: that it must be lived forwards.\u201d This observation was made in 1843 by the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard in a journal entry, but it might have been written about the contemporary Middle East. \nWe have been living the Islamic State forwards, surprised at every turn, but we can perhaps begin to understand it backwards. Although ISIS took most of the world by surprise when it swept into the Iraqi city of Mosul in June 2014, the group and its forebears had been proclaiming their goals for a decade. Like many consequential events, this one didn\u2019t sneak up on policymakers; they simply didn\u2019t see what was taking shape in front of them. ISIS told us exactly what it was going to do, and then did it. This was a secret conspiracy hiding in plain sight. Exploring the hard choices facing the United States and the world Read More \nISIS is mysterious in part because it is so many things at once. It combines Islamic piety and reverence for the prophet and his companions with the most modern social-media platforms and encryption schemes; its videos blend the raw pornographic violence of a snuff film with the pious chanting of religious warriors; the group has the discipline of a prison gang (many of its recruits were indeed drawn from U.S.-organized prisons in Iraq), but also the tactical subtlety and capacity for deception of the most skilled members of Saddam Hussein\u2019s intelligence services, who were also pulled into the ISIS net. It appears less brittle than al-Qaeda because its members care less about religious doctrine and organizational hierarchy. As has been said of the Episcopal Church (forgive the comparison), ISIS is solid at the core but loose at the edges. \nWhat is ravaging the Middle East right now is obviously deeper than ISIS. It has become commonplace over the last year to observe that we are witnessing the collapse of the post-Ottoman order\u2014that the \u201clines in the sand\u201d conjured in 1916 by the British and French diplomats Mark Sykes and Fran\u00e7ois Georges-Picot are being blown to dust. But we haven\u2019t reckoned with how the insurgents perceive that process. ISIS has religious, psychological, and technological faces. But in some fundamental respects it is an anti-colonial movement that takes as its reference point Islam\u2019s pre-colonial conception of power\u2014an Islamic state, a Sunni caliphate. Even if ISIS is crushed, this idea of \u201cour caliphate\u201d is likely to persist, and return. Related Story \nThe Syrian Civil War: What? \nThe story of ISIS teaches the same basic lesson that emerged from America\u2019s other failures in the Middle East over the last decade: Attempts by the United States or Islamist rebels to topple authoritarian regimes\u2014in Iraq, Libya, and now Syria\u2014create power vacuums. This empty political space will be filled by extremists unless the United States and its allies build strong local forces that can suppress terrorist groups and warlords both. When the U.S. creates such local forces, it must be persistent. If it withdraws from these efforts, as America did in Iraq in 2011, it invites mayhem. Halfway American intervention has produced nothing but trouble. Rebels have gotten enough support to continue fighting, but not enough to win. \nHistory teaches that such wars end through a combination of the exhaustion of local combatants and an agreement among major regional and international powers on a formula to curtail the fighting and rebuild some governance. Usually the settlement ratifies the informal cantonal boundaries that have emerged during the fighting, so that each sect has what amounts to a \u201csafe zone\u201d in a decentralized state that functions under the umbrella of the old nation. That\u2019s what happened in Lebanon with the Taif Agreement in 1989, and it\u2019s probably the best that can be hoped for in Iraq and Syria. To reduce human suffering on the way to such a new equilibrium, it\u2019s important, where possible, to back moderate forces as they create the safe zones that will eventually form the pieces of the new federal state\u2014and that provide platforms for attacking extremist groups. Middle Eastern wars rarely end with outright victory and permanent stability, so the word \u201csettlement\u201d may promise too much. At best, for many years, it may simply mean stable ceasefire lines, reduced bloodshed, fewer refugees, and less terrorism. \nUltimately, the errors of judgment that led to ISIS\u2019s rise have been too consequential for any easy prescriptive advice. Instead, I share a comment made to me in June 2003, as this terrible story was beginning, by a Syrian businessman named Raja Sidawi. Here\u2019s a passage from the Washington Post column that quoted my friend\u2019s warning: \n\u201cI am sorry for America,\u201d Sidawi said. \u201cYou are stuck. You have become a country of the Middle East. America will never change Iraq, but Iraq will change America.\u201d \u2026 \nThis tragic sensibility\u2014the sense that in most instances, things do not work out as you might have hoped\u2014is generally lacking in the American character. Americans are an optimistic people: They have difficulty imagining the worst. That was why 9/11 was so shocking. Most Americans never considered that such devastation could be visited on them. \nArabs grow up in a culture where it is always best to assume the worst. Sidawi rattled off the list of wars and disasters that have afflicted the Middle East almost continuously since he was born in 1939. That is the bloody history in which America has now enmeshed itself. \n\u201cYou will learn the culture of death,\u201d warned Sidawi. \nAnd so we have. The Iraqi Roots of ISIS \nThe Koranic message of submission and jihad is perhaps as powerful now for believers as it was in 622 A.D., when the Prophet Muhammad gathered his followers in Medina and began raiding neighboring areas. The historian Robert G. Hoyland described this ideological spark in his book In God\u2019s Path: The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire . It\u2019s the same idea that is evoked in the nasheeds , or Islamic chants, that provide the soundtrack for many ISIS videos today: \u201cWhat is most striking is the very simple but powerful program of action outlined by Muhammad: form a righteous community (umma) , go to a safe place (hijra) , and from there embark on jihad against the unrighteous,\u201d noted Hoyland. \nBut religion alone cannot explain the growth of the first caliphate in the seventhcentury, any more than it can the rapid expansion of the current, self-proclaimed successor caliphate. The spark of jihad ignited and spread so quickly after Muhammad\u2019s death in 632 in part because it fell on the dry tinder of a region enfeebled by imperial wars that had exhausted the Byzantine and Persian Empires. \u201cYou are stuck. You have become a country of the Middle East. America will never change Iraq, but Iraq will change America.\u201d \n\u201cThe change was so sudden and unexpected that it needs explanation,\u201d wrote Albert Hourani in his landmark study, A History of the Arab Peoples . He noted archeological evidence indicating that the prosperity of the eastern Mediterranean had been undermined by invasions and the loss of agricultural techniques such as terraced farming. It was a region ripe for plunder. \u201cThe Arabs who invaded the two empires were not a tribal horde but an organized force, some of whose members had acquired military skill and experience in the service of the empires or in the fighting after the death of the Prophet,\u201d he wrote. (Reading Hourani\u2019s words, I couldn\u2019t help but think of the unlikely contemporary alliance between ISIS religious zealots and ex-Baathists who served in Saddam Hussein\u2019s most secret and brutal units.) \nThe story of how the forebears of ISIS got started in Iraq is largely the story of a rough-hewn, charismatic al-Qaeda recruit named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Back in 2003, observed an anonymous former Western official recently in The New York Review of Books , who \u201ccould have imagined that a movement founded by a man [who once worked in] a video store in provincial Jordan would tear off a third of the territory of Syria and Iraq, shatter all these historical institutions and\u2014defeating the combined armies of a dozen of the wealthiest countries on earth\u2014create a mini-empire?\u201d \nZarqawi made his name challenging the grandees of al-Qaeda: the wealthy Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden and the Egyptian doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri. Whereas al-Qaeda\u2019s core leadership planned meticulous, top-down operations, Zarqawi strove instead to emulate the romantic, Crusader-conquering Nur al-Din Zengi, who drove Westerners from Syria. \nConvinced the Americans would invade Iraq, Zarqawi began building a base there in 2002; when they did so a year later, he proved willing to ally with remnants of Saddam\u2019s intelligence network. The story is well told by William McCants in his excellent new book, The ISIS Apocalypse. Four months after the U.S. invasion, Zarqawi\u2019s organization attacked three well-chosen targets\u2014UN headquarters in Baghdad, the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad, and the Imam Ali Mosque, a Shiite shrine, in Najaf\u2014that signaled the dirty war ahead. These bombs shattered the ground for reconciliation: Iraq would be a no-go zone for the international organizations that might have lightened the burden of U.S. occupation; Iraq\u2019s links would be severed with its mainstream Sunni patron, Jordan; and Iraq would be cleaved apart by a vicious sectarian war between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, whose coexistence had been a feature of modern Iraqi life. Zarqawi\u2019s game plan was set by late August 2003; at the time, the United States was still denying there was an insurgency in the country. A U.S. marine passes Iraqis sitting outside their house during a patrol in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2005. (Anja Niedringhaus / AP) \nMy recollection of Iraq in late 2003 was of growing violence from Zarqawi\u2019s Sunni insurgency, yes. But even more, I was struck by the desperation of Iraq\u2019s Sunni sheikhs, who feared and in many cases despised the brutal Zarqawi, but couldn\u2019t get tone-deaf U.S. officials in the international Green Zone to take their problems seriously. \nTake Fallujah, a sprawling city just west of Baghdad and one of Zarqawi\u2019s early recruiting grounds. Fallujah\u2019s Sunni male residents all seemed to have served in the army or worked as smugglers (or both), and the tribal elders there wanted the United States to provide protection from Zarqawi and a deal that would give the Sunnis a share of the post-invasion spoils. But their pleas were largely ignored. When I visited Sheikh Khamis al-Hassnawi at his villa near the Euphrates River in September 2003, he spoke not only of procuring an American wife (he seemed to have formed his impressions of the U.S. from Baywatch ), but also of the dire need for American aid and an ongoing American military presence in the country. \u201cIf coalition forces withdraw now, the strong will eat the weak, and people will start killing each other in the street,\u201d he said . \nThat proved an accurate forecast of what occurred from 2004 on, before U.S. forces embraced a \u201cclear and hold\u201d counterinsurgency policy for Iraq. For the social engineers in the Green Zone, the downtrodden Kurds and Shiites were the instruments for change in the New Iraq. If the Sunnis wouldn\u2019t go along, too bad for them. In this period of growing insurgency and civil war, I remember one prominent U.S. National Security Council official telling me more than once that the answer for Iraq was the \u201c80-percent solution\u201d\u2014in other words, Kurds and Shiites would build the new state regardless of opposition from the 20 percent of the population that was Sunni. This view was recklessness dressed up as realpolitik. \nAs Zarqawi\u2019s toxic violence escalated, especially toward Shiites, bin Laden and his top deputies became concerned. Zawahiri warned Zarqawi to stop showing beheadings in the videos he posted online. McCants quotes Zawahiri\u2019s admonition that these ultra-violent images might excite \u201czealous young men\u201d but would appall ordinary Muslims. \u201cWe are in a media battle in a race for the hearts and minds of our community,\u201d Zawahiri warned. The message was, in effect: Don\u2019t burn too hot; you\u2019ll burn yourself out. By 2009, the movement Zarqawi created was all but dead. But not quite. Embers of his Islamic state remained, kept alive by Sunni rage. \nThe hotheads in Iraq didn\u2019t listen, especially when it came to their pet project of declaring an Islamic state in Iraq. Zarqawi\u2019s first discussions of creating a caliphate date back to 2004, according to McCants. Al-Qaeda\u2019s supreme command disagreed; bin Laden felt that moving too soon for power in Iraq and Yemen, the movement\u2019s two strongholds, would lead to premature defeat and tarnish the brand. \nU.S. airstrikes killed Zarqawi in June 2006, but his renegade followers nevertheless went on to declare their state, the Islamic State of Iraq, in October 2006, without consulting al-Qaeda leaders. Simultaneously, the sectarian war Zarqawi had launched against the Shiites was proving all too successful. Fifty or more bodies were found every morning in Baghdad; it was said that the Sunnis usually beheaded their victims, while the Shiites drilled holes in their heads. The U.S. government was still in denial; a Washington Post reporter who scouted the morgues to count dead bodies was accused by officials of inflating the numbers. \nOver the next two years, however, the prudence of al-Qaeda\u2019s core leaders began to seem warranted. U.S. President George W. Bush embraced General David Petraeus\u2019s \u201ctroop surge\u201d and the counterinsurgency philosophy that drove it. A counter-rebellion of Sunni tribal leaders already underway was christened the \u201cAwakening\u201d and received new American money and attention. Tribal fighters and U.S. special-operations forces took the fight ruthlessly to al-Qaeda in Iraq, ignoring its rhetoric about an Islamic state. By 2009, the end of the surge years, the movement Zarqawi had created was all but dead. \nBut not quite. A few embers of Zarqawi\u2019s Islamic state remained, kept alive by flickering Sunni rage. The flame was nurtured at U.S.-organized Iraqi prisons such as Camp Bucca, where religious Sunni detainees mingled with former members of Saddam\u2019s Baath Party, and the nucleus of a reborn movement took shape. \u201cEveryone tells me they\u2019ve never seen what\u2019s happening on the ground now. Hell has come to these villages and towns. It\u2019s far worse than before.\u201d \nDid U.S. officials know or care about the fire building beneath the Iraqi state, led at the time by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki? Apparently not. Maliki, a Shiite, was proving corrupt and sectarian in his rule, displacing Sunnis from their few handholds of power in the new state. The Iraqi people sensed that Maliki was wrecking their country, and in March 2010 elections voted out his coalition in favor of a more inclusive group headed by the pro-American former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. \nIn what can only be described as an act of folly, the United States (with Iran as a silent partner) contrived a horse-trading process that kept Maliki in power. Vice President Joe Biden, who was in charge of the dickering, was fond of proclaiming that \u201cpolitics has broken out in Iraq.\u201d Iraqi politicians concluded (probably correctly) that the Obama administration had decided to leave the country to its own machinations. Nobody imagined in Washington (and few seemed to understand in Baghdad) that this future would empower as never before the Islamic State. \nIn the years after Maliki\u2019s 2010 \u201creelection,\u201d the Islamic State engaged in a ruthless campaign of assassination against Sunni tribal leaders and the remnants of the Awakening movement in Iraq\u2019s Anbar province. Between 2009 and 2013, the Islamic State killed 1,345 Awakening members, according to doctoral research by the former U.S. Army officer Craig Whiteside. In Jurf al-Sakhar, a town south of Baghdad, 46 Awakening members were killed in 27 incidents over this four-year period. The slaughter was hardly a secret: ISIS documented the drive-by shootings and point-blank assassinations in a video called \u201c The Clanging of the Swords .\u201d Was anyone watching in Washington? Evidently not. Officials in Baghdad, meanwhile, didn\u2019t seem to care; Maliki\u2019s government was probably as happy to see the killing of potentially powerful Sunnis as was ISIS. \nThe assassination campaign weakened Sunni resistance, helping ISIS seize Mosul in 2014. It helped too that ISIS had used Iraqi prisons as its training camps, building trust, operations security, and a passionate hatred for the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. This was a guerrilla army in waiting, and ISIS staged a campaign called \u201cBreaking the Walls\u201d to free these captives and bring them into the fight. Whiteside estimates that between July 2012 and July 2013, ISIS orchestrated seven major prisons raids, culminating in a spectacular, well-organized breakout at Abu Ghraib. (One of the first things ISIS did after sweeping through Mosul was to liberate the prison there, adding several thousand fighters to its burgeoning ranks.) One graduate of these prisons turned schools for jihad, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is the current leader of ISIS. Pro-ISIS demonstrators march in Mosul, Iraq, in June 2014. (AP) \nPrior to the storming of Mosul, did anyone at senior levels of the Obama administration notice that, as the poet W.H. Auden wrote of the carnage of the Spanish Civil War, \u201cour fever\u2019s menacing shapes are precise and alive\u201d? Apparently not. As U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted in an interview with me in September 2014: \u201cWe underestimated ISIL [the Islamic State] and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi Army. \u2026 I didn\u2019t see the collapse of the Iraqi security force in the north coming. \u2026 It boils down to predicting the will to fight, which is an imponderable.\u201d \nBut ISIS\u2019s potency was certainly clear to Sunni tribal leaders. In April 2014, two months before the capture of Mosul, I interviewed Iraqi sheikhs from Anbar. One of them, Jalal al-Gaood, told me by phone that in his hometown of Albu Ali Jassim, west of Ramadi, violent extremists had attacked a police building, prompting the Iraqi military to bomb and shell the village, and his entire tribe to move out of the area. Gaood offered a grim prediction: \u201cEveryone tells me they\u2019ve never seen what\u2019s happening on the ground now. Hell has come to these villages and towns. It\u2019s far worse than before.\u201d Sheikh Zaydan al-Jabari, a tribal leader from Ramadi, told me that day: \u201cIraq is not now a state. It is led by gangs.\u201d Related Story \nWhat ISIS Really Wants \nBarack Obama couldn\u2019t ignore the capture of Mosul. But even after the U.S. president successfully pushed to replace Maliki with a less sectarian prime minister, America struggled to gain the trust of Sunni leaders and recruit the kind of force that could roll back ISIS\u2019s gains. In October 2014, on the morning after ISIS had gutted the pro-American fighters of his Albu Nimr tribe, Gaood told me that his pleas that night for help from U.S. Central Command had gone unanswered: \u201cEvery time the Iraqis meet with Americans, [the Americans] just take notes,\u201d he complained . \nThat same month, Jabari said that the Sunni tribes again wanted U.S. help and \u201ca strategic relationship with the Americans.\u201d Yet he scoffed at U.S. plans to create a national guard for the Sunnis, saying it was \u201cwishful thinking\u201d because Iraq\u2019s Shiites and Kurds would never agree to the proposal. Until Sunni rights are respected, he said bitterly, \u201cwe will not allow the world to sleep.\u201d His warnings have so far proven correct: The U.S.-backed legislation that would authorize a Sunni national guard remains stalled in the Shiite-dominated Iraqi parliament. A Shiite paramilitary fighter in Tikrit, Iraq, puts Iraqi flags on a wall painted with the black flag commonly used by Islamic State militants. (Reuters) \nI saw Jabari again in June 2015, a few weeks after ISIS had overrun the city of Ramadi (after bland reassurances from U.S. CENTCOM officials that the city would hold). Jabari was seeking support for his tribal fighters. (Like several Anbar sheikhs, he had by now hired his own D.C. lobbying firm.) \n\u201cIraqis don\u2019t want to live under the Islamic State, but where are they supposed to go?\u201d he asked me. Shiite militias had blocked the way to Baghdad for Sunnis fleeing Ramadi; ISIS, meanwhile, was offering amnesty to families who came back to the city and turned over their sons to the Islamic State to fight. These tribal leaders simply do not believe U.S. assurances that America is in this fight for real. The sheikhs are selfish and self-interested, but can you blame them? They\u2019ve been burned too often. The problem with the U.S. anti-ISIS strategy in Iraq is that it depends on a Sunni tribal movement that no longer exists. * * * \nWhat lessons can be drawn from the rise of ISIS in Iraq and the campaign so far against it? \nFirst, anti-ISIS ground and air operations have been successful when they have been launched from areas with strong operational and planning resources and well-trained and motivated fighters. Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region is the obvious example, as I saw on a recent visit: Kurdistan Democratic Party peshmerga fighters under the Barzani clan have pushed ISIS west and south, and squeezed ISIS-held Mosul. A visitor can drive unmolested today into the northern province of Nineveh and over the Mosul Dam, which in the fall of 2014 was in ISIS hands. Patriotic Union of Kurdistan militias have held their own in the northern Kirkuk area, though there\u2019s growing concern among the Kurds and Americans that they are taking orders from Iran and its Quds Force. Similarly, Shiite militias, under Iranian supervision, have fought well in defending Baghdad. \u201cIf you add everything up \u2026 [ISIS] could win. Evil isn\u2019t always defeated.\u201d \nThe problem remains creating a Sunni force that can help the Iraqi military push ISIS from Mosul, Fallujah, and Ramadi, and then hold the retaken ground. Such a force would have to operate from a secure base\u2014not just a logistical base, but a base of trust, in which the Sunnis feel they are fighting for a part of Iraq that will truly be theirs post-ISIS. Iraq\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Lukman Faily, has told me he favors constitutional changes that would create the kind of Iraqi federalism that would truly give Sunnis some \u201cskin in the game\u201d and make a decentralized Iraq work. \nAbsent this essential political component, it\u2019s hard to imagine how the current U.S. strategy against ISIS can work. U.S. military power could drive the heirs of Zarqawi underground, but without Sunni empowerment, the insurgents will be back as ISIS 2.0 or 3.0. It\u2019s now clear that the \u201c80-percent solution\u201d is shorthand for the violent dismemberment of Iraq. If some new political balance that allows Sunnis to govern their land can\u2019t be created in the country, we must reckon with the stark warning of the CIA\u2019s former deputy director, John McLaughlin, to The New York Times : \u201cIf you add everything up \u2026 [ISIS] could win. Evil isn\u2019t always defeated.\u201d The Syrian Roots of ISIS \nDisentangling the story of ISIS\u2019s expansion in Iraq at least produces a coherent narrative. That\u2019s less true in Syria. The spread of the Islamic State there seems, in the famous French dictum, \u201cworse than a crime, a blunder.\u201d We\u2019ll never know whether a more aggressive U.S. policy\u2014arming the moderate Syrian opposition sooner or bombing the Syrian government\u2019s command-and-control infrastructure after President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his people\u2014could have produced a better outcome. But it\u2019s hard to imagine a policy that would have done worse. \nWhere ISIS experienced organic growth in Iraq (in the sense that a metastasizing cancer can be called organic), in Syria it seems more a case of implantation. For all the mistakes in U.S. policy, the regional powers\u2014Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar\u2014have taken truly reckless actions, making Syria a cockpit for their proxy wars. It was Turkey that allowed a southern border with Syria so porous that it offered ISIS and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra what amounted to a logistical safe zone. It was Iran that marched Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia whose mission was fighting Israel, into Syria to save Assad. It was Saudi Arabia and Qatar, jockeying for regional influence, that funded a scattershot array of Sunni militias that proved easy recruiting grounds for the extremists (and in this sense supported the extremists). And it was Russia that stood by while its client, Assad, bombed civilians and ravaged his nation, and then began doing the bombing itself.

(Goran Tomasevic / Reuters) \nRussia\u2019s recent military intervention in Syria\u2014nominally to fight the extremists, but more to prop up a government that protects Russian interests\u2014is power politics in its rawest form. Vladimir Putin understood this summer (as the CIA did) that Assad\u2019s regime was losing ground to Islamic rebel groups. Russian military operations (coordinated with Iran) were focused not on ISIS strongholds in the northeast, but on U.S.- and Saudi-backed forces in the northwest, close to Assad\u2019s Alawite homeland in Latakia. Putin may be angling to strengthen Assad\u2019s hand in anticipation of the political negotiation that both Moscow and Washington say is needed. But so far, the Russian-Iranian partnership with Assad has only deepened the sectarian nature of the war. \nMeanwhile, U.S. strategy in Syria has been so feeble (and its implementation so inept, as in the worst days of the Green Zone) that the United States at this writing seems like a junior partner, with Russia taking the decisive role in shaping the battle against ISIS. \nSyria seems increasingly like one of those Agatha Christie books where every character has had a hand in the crime. \nI first visited Syria in the early 1980s, witnessing the systematic destruction that Assad\u2019s father, Hafez, had visited upon Muslim Brotherhood strongholds in Hama. Later, I was one of many Westerners who had regular conversations with Assad and his advisors between 2000 and 2010 about what the Syrian president claimed was his recognition of the need for political reform in Syria. As a result, I traveled to Damascus from Cairo in February 2011 with great curiosity. In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak\u2019s government had just fallen in the Tahrir Square revolution that marked the apex of the Arab Spring. What would Damascus, scene of so many coups and counter-coups during its modern history, bring to this revolutionary moment? Syria seems like one of those Agatha Christie books where every character has had a hand in the crime. \nAssad\u2019s advisors were buzzing about the president\u2019s plans for reform. He knew his Baath Party was corrupt, one insisted. He knew the power of his relatives, the Makhlouf family, had to be curbed, said another. Reformers confided how on February 19, police had assaulted a driver in downtown Damascus. It was a normal day in authoritarian Damascus\u2014but not in the age of the cell phone and the hashtag. Hundreds quickly gathered in the capital\u2019s streets and began chanting: \u201cWe are the people. The people won\u2019t be humiliated.\u201d Video footage of the drama was posted to the Internet, and made its way into Syrian homes. Syrian officials initially responded wisely. The minister of the interior arrived about 30 minutes after the protest started, apologized to the man who had been beaten, and escorted him away in his car. The police officers were disciplined. The crowd gradually ebbed, and some (doubtless with official encouragement) began chanting Assad\u2019s name. \nThe regime wasn\u2019t so lucky a few weeks later when protests spread to Daraa, the provincial capital south of Damascus. The Houranis (as the people of this region are known) are famously feisty, and they pushed the local police and military hard. The authorities, led by a bullheaded provincial governor, started firing back. Civilians were slaughtered. And the Syrian revolution had begun. \nSeveral factors made this revolution especially disorganized (and prey to manipulation by extremists). First, it was a genuinely bottom-up movement, with each mosque gathering its own young men into brigades to defend the local area and then (in theory) fight a larger war to overthrow the regime. The Muslim Brotherhood, devastated by Hafez al-Assad in 1982, lacked the discipline and organization that could have helped weld a strong opposition. The moderates were hapless. Anti-Syrian government protesters during a demonstration in Homs province in January 2012 (AP) \nSecond, as in Iraq, the revolution arrived in a country that had suppressed deep sectarian divisions. Sunnis appreciated the stability and \u201cArabism\u201d that the Assad regimes had brought, but they felt humiliated by their subservience to leaders who many derided as Alawite bumpkins from the mountains. In light of these tensions, Syrian minorities banded together behind the regime. \nBecause of the disorganization of the opposition, and the sectarian character of Syrian society, the civil war got nastier after 2011. Inevitably, the opposition became more Sunni and proto-jihadist. In October 2012, I traveled inside the country for two days with the help of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), and came to three basic judgments : First, there aren\u2019t enough weapons for the rebels to defeat Assad\u2019s forces, and almost every Syrian I talked to thinks this is America\u2019s fault; second, the commanders of the Free Syrian Army are trying to exercise better command and control over what has been a disorganized, ragtag operation; and third, in this chaotic and under-resourced fight, the power of the Salafist jihadists\u2014who ask only to be martyrs\u2014appears to be growing. \nIt seemed clear that absent U.S. training and assistance of the moderate opposition, these problems would only get worse. \nA CIA covert training program began , sort of, in 2013. Working with the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate (GID), the CIA had some success in building a \u201csouthern front,\u201d but U.S. and Jordanian policy restrained the opposition from any move that might topple Assad prematurely, before his successor was clear. The CIA\u2019s program had even less success in the north. I\u2019ve interviewed most of the pro-American moderate commanders who operated from Turkey: a former military-science professor named Selim Idriss; a loud former Syrian Army colonel named Abdul-Jabar Akaidi; a roustabout guerrilla leader in Idlib named Jamaal Maarouf; and Hamza al-Shamali, the leader of what was the largest CIA-trained force in the north, known as Harakat al-Hazm. \nNone of these Syrian commanders had the military leadership skills or command presence to create an effective opposition. Shamali\u2019s group got chased from its bases in Idlib by the jihadists from Nusra. \u201cAt some point, the Syrian street lost trust in the Free Syrian Army,\u201d Shamali explained to me in a 2014 interview at a safe house along the Turkish border. He bluntly admitted that many FSA commanders weren\u2019t disciplined, FSA fighters were poorly trained, and the loose FSA structure hadn\u2019t provided adequate command-and-control capability. Sadly, he said, \u201cthe question every Syrian has for the opposition is: \u2018Are you going to bring chaos or order?\u2019\u201d A Free Syrian Army fighter throws a bomb toward forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Deir al-Zor, Syria, in December 2013. (Khalil Ashawi / Reuters) \nThe United States tried to bolster these nominally covert Syrian missions with an overt \u201ctrain and equip\u201d program backed by $500 million in congressional support. The program proved a dismal failure, and was terminated by Obama in October. A first \u201cclass\u201d of 54 trainees was inserted into northern Syria in July 2015 and promptly attacked by Nusra fighters. The debacle resulted from poor intelligence about Nusra\u2019s intentions, poor planning about how the U.S.-backed force would operate on the ground, and an unworkable system for vetting recruits that disallowed those who wanted to fight Assad rather than ISIS. The U.S.-backed rebels, in effect, walked into a trap\u2014in a mission that recalled, to some Pentagon officials, the failed Bay of Pigs landing in Cuba in 1961. To me, the botched effort encapsulated all the contradictions and uncertainties of U.S. policy. \nSome in the White House seemed almost to gloat over the collapse of the train-and-equip program, as if this showed that their reluctance to back Syrian rebels had been right all along. How nice it would be if American inaction\u2014and America\u2019s waffling, wobbling approach to Syria\u2014could be described as success. Alas, not so. \nThe extremists of ISIS and al-Qaeda filled the vacuum left by the moderate opposition. Early in the war, the momentum seemed to be with Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate. When I asked an FSA commander in Aleppo in 2012 whether his men fought with Nusra, he answered: \u201cOf course, they\u2019re the best fighters.\u201d If the FSA needed hardened men for an assault, they would turn to the suicide bombers of Nusra, who were often foreign fighters looking for a ticket to paradise. I asked a Syrian doctor what he had learned from treating rebel casualties at the front. A large majority of those with serious wounds were from Nusra, he said. Inevitably, people, arms, and money began flowing to the fighters who were the toughest and best. Assad needed to demonstrate that there was a worse Syrian face than his own\u2014that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS\u2019s leader. \nISIS played a spoiler\u2019s game in Syria. It moved to Raqqa, an area adjacent to its supply lines into Iraq, and used the city as a kind of logistics base camp for its bigger Iraq operations. Raqqa soon became the \u201ccapital\u201d of the \u201cstate,\u201d and the destination for thousands of foreign fighters. It prospered in part because it wasn\u2019t bombed by Assad\u2019s air force, which was leveling every other civilian area under rebel control. \nYou don\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theorist to understand why Assad allowed ISIS to put down roots: He needed a threat to show the West why his regime\u2019s survival mattered; he needed to demonstrate that there was a worse Syrian face than his own\u2014that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS\u2019s leader. (If you are a conspiracy theorist, you would also note the strong intelligence connections that developed between the Syrian Mukhabarat and al-Qaeda in Iraq during the Zarqawi days.) * * * \nSince visiting Syria in 2012, I have believed that the shattered nation can gradually be stabilized if the United States and its allies seriously commit to building a new Syrian force that can help fill the vacuum, post-Assad. But the halfway measures taken by the U.S. thus far have only helped the jihadists. \nFriction between ISIS and Nusra is nearly as strong as the old infighting between Zarqawi and bin Laden. The United States and its allies are doubtless working to exacerbate these cleavages, which suggest that the jihadists\u2019 power can be degraded over time in Syria. Raqqa is now flanked to the north by Syrian Kurdish forces who are receiving ammunition and air support from the United States; as the squeeze intensifies on ISIS forces there, Nusra will have to decide whether it wants to come to the apostates\u2019 aid or let them be pounded. Either way, Nusra will suffer in the eyes of its followers. The U.S. has created enemies that did not exist before 2003; it has fostered a degree of mistrust so acute that many in the Middle East welcome Putin as a deliverer. \nShould the United States and its allies target Nusra and ISIS equally? Prudence argues for a strategy that treats ISIS as the first priority. The toppling of ISIS would curb the momentum of extremist forces more generally. Some Qatari officials have told me they think Nusra can be split into several factions, and that many of its fighters can be co-opted by Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or Turkey into less menacing groups that reject foreign terror operations. This may be wishful thinking, but it\u2019s worth exploring. The message to Nusra should be that attempts to spread terror outside Syria will provoke devastating U.S. and allied attacks. \nWhat\u2019s the pathway out of the Syrian disaster? Based on my reporting, I\u2019d offer several conclusions, which haven\u2019t changed much in the last three years: The best hope for Syria\u2019s survival is a political solution\u2014jointly brokered by the U.S., Russia, Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia\u2014that begins the transition to a new, post-Assad government. But such a political solution will be impossible without a strong, U.S.-backed opposition that can merge with \u201cacceptable\u201d elements of the Syrian army to manage a transition from Assad. This transition process will be fostered by safe zones in the north and south, where humanitarian assistance can be directed, Syrian refugees can return, and political compromise can be rediscovered. If these steps cannot be taken, the result will be the continuing growth of ISIS and other extremist groups, and the full collapse of a fractured Syria into a failed state and terrorist haven. Russian-Iranian military intervention can widen the boundaries of Assad\u2019s rump state, but it cannot rebuild a united Syria. \nISIS\u2019s power will only be enhanced in Syria by Assad\u2019s continued hold on power. That\u2019s why a campaign against ISIS that doesn\u2019t include the goal of bringing new leadership to Syria is short-sighted. And yet fears that a freewheeling regime collapse would give way to warlordism and terror across Syria are justified. For now, Syria offers a grim lesson: Muddled U.S. policies can produce as disastrous an outcome as military intervention. \nMy friend Raja Sidawi was right 12 years ago: America has not changed Iraq or Syria, but the wars there have indeed changed America. Americans have learned the limits of military power and covert action; the U.S. has helped create enemies that did not exist before George W. Bush\u2019s mistaken invasion of Iraq in 2003 (I described my own mistakes in supporting the Iraq War, and explained the lessons I drew from this horrible experience, in a 2013 column ); it has fostered a degree of mistrust so acute that many in the region now welcome the vain autocrat Vladimir Putin as a deliverer. Obama\u2019s policies may have been weak and feckless, but they have reflected a widespread desire among Americans to extricate the country from the Middle East\u2019s long wars. \nAs Russian planes conduct dozens of sorties a day over Syria, the cover of the November/December 2015 issue of Foreign Affairs proclaims: \u201c The Post-American Middle East .\u201d That\u2019s a bit hasty. Nothing in this part of the world is ever really over. But the people of the Middle East finally own their own history. The only people who can fix this mess are the citizens of the region themselves, and it\u2019s going to take a very long time. \nThis article is adapted from a paper for a forthcoming series from the Aspen Strategy Group.
