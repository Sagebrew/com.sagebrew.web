    "text": "Story highlights Police conduct raids around Brussels for people linked to the attacks, state broadcaster reports Authorities in New York, Washington, Chicago and L.A. step up patrols after Brussels attacks Two explosions ripped through the Brussels Airport, and another happened at a subway station Brussels, Belgium (CNN) Three explosions that ripped through the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday killed at least 34 people and wounded about 170 more, according to Belgian media, and raised the reality of terror once again in the heart of Europe.\n\"We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters.\nBelgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport.\nAfter the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks.\nCiting judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks.\nRead More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.\nBrussels under attack: Live updates\n20 photos: Terror attacks in Brussels An injured woman leaves the Brussels airport after at least two explosions rocked the facility Tuesday, March 22.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based.\nRichard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for.\n\"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\"\nYet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\"\nThat doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening.\n\"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\"\nEurope, U.S. on alert as well\nBelgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport.\nThis comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs.\nIn addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside.\nThe ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well.\nAs far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon.\nSimilar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe.\nEurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels.\nUPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station.\n\u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium.\n\"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\"\nBritish police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard.\n1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport.\n\u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\n\"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\"\n\"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\"\nAirport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down\nThe darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building.\n\"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN.\nBarrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded.\nIn the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\"\nCNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added.\n\"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\"\nTraveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint.\nHe says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways.\nSoccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity'\nAbout an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station.\nPeople wounded outside #maelbeek #metro #brussels @cnnireport #brusselsattacks #maalbeek pic.twitter.com/JaqUEOz7Tl\n\u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks.\n\"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\"\nJUST WATCHED Subway witness: We fled through smoke Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nSubway witness: We fled through smoke 01:36 The Belgian crisis center tweeted that all public transportation in the city has been closed.\n\"Stay where you are,\" it said.\nKristalina Georgieva, the vice president of the European Commission, said that all the organization's institutions are at \"alert level orange\" and that all meetings on its premises and outside have been canceled.\nShe advised people to stay at home or indoors.\n\"I am shocked and concerned by the events in Brussels,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted. \"We will do everything we can to help.\"\nI am shocked and concerned by the events in Brussels. We will do everything we can to help.\n\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) March 22, 2016 Abdeslam, who authorities say was involved in the Paris terror attacks last year, was arrested in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek on Friday.\nBelgium's Prime Minister deflected a question about whether there's any link between Tuesday's bloodshed and Abdeslam's capture, saying it is too early to tell.\nHe said Tuesday that he had \"no information\" about who was responsible for the attack, adding that authorities will find that out, but right now their focus is on caring for the victims.\nBelgian national soccer team captain Vincent Kompany tweeted that he was \"horrified and revolted (that) innocent people (are) paying the price again,\" but he urged people not to encourage those wishing to lash out.\n\"We must reject hate and its preachers,\" Kompany said. \"... I wish for Brussels to act with dignity.\"\nFollow Joshua Berlinger on Twitter",

    "text": "Story highlights Police conduct raids around Brussels for people linked to the attacks, state broadcaster reports Authorities in New York, Washington, Chicago and L.A. step up patrols after Brussels attacks Two explosions ripped through the Brussels Airport, and another happened at a subway station Brussels, Belgium (CNN) Three explosions that ripped through the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday killed at least 34 people and wounded about 170 more, according to Belgian media, and raised the reality of terror once again in the heart of Europe.\n\"We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters.\nBelgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport.\nAfter the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks.\nCiting judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks.\nRead More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.\nBrussels under attack: Live updates\n20 photos: Terror attacks in Brussels An injured woman leaves the Brussels airport after at least two explosions rocked the facility Tuesday, March 22.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based.\nRichard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for.\n\"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\"\nYet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\"\nThat doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening.\n\"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\"\nEurope, U.S. on alert as well\nBelgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport.\nThis comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs.\nIn addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside.\nThe ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well.\nAs far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon.\nSimilar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe.\nEurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels.\nUPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station.\n\u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium.\n\"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\"\nBritish police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard.\n1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport.\n\u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\n\"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\"\n\"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\"\nAirport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down\nThe darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building.\n\"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN.\nBarrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded.\nIn the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\"\nCNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added.\n\"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\"\nTraveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint.\nHe says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways.\nSoccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity'\nAbout an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station.\nPeople wounded outside #maelbeek #metro #brussels @cnnireport #brusselsattacks #maalbeek pic.twitter.com/JaqUEOz7Tl\n\u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks.\n\"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\"\nJUST WATCHED Subway witness: We fled through smoke Replay More Videos ...

    "text": "Story highlights Police conduct raids around Brussels for people linked to the attacks, state broadcaster reports Authorities in New York, Washington, Chicago and L.A. step up patrols after Brussels attacks Two explosions ripped through the Brussels Airport, and another happened at a subway station Brussels, Belgium (CNN) Three explosions that ripped through the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday killed at least 34 people and wounded about 170 more, according to Belgian media, and raised the reality of terror once again in the heart of Europe.\n\"We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters.\nBelgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport.\nAfter the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks.\nCiting judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks.\nRead More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.\nBrussels under attack: Live updates\n20 photos: Terror attacks in Brussels An injured woman leaves the Brussels airport after at least two explosions rocked the facility Tuesday, March 22.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based.\nRichard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for.\n\"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\"\nYet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\"\nThat doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening.\n\"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\"\nEurope, U.S. on alert as well\nBelgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport.\nThis comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs.\nIn addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside.\nThe ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well.\nAs far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon.\nSimilar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe.\nEurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels.\nUPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station.\n\u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium.\n\"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\"\nBritish police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard.\n1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport.\n\u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\n\"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\"\n\"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\"\nAirport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down\nThe darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building.\n\"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN.\nBarrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded.\nIn the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\"\nCNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added.\n\"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\"\nTraveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint.\nHe says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways.\nSoccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity'\nAbout an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station.\nPeople wounded outside #maelbeek #metro #brussels @cnnireport #brusselsattacks #maalbeek pic.twitter.com/JaqUEOz7Tl\n\u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks.\n\"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\"\nJUST WATCHED Subway witness: We fled through smoke Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nSubway witness: We fled through smoke 01:36 The Belgian crisis center tweeted that all public transportation in the city has been closed.\n\"Stay where you are,\" it said.\nKristalina Georgieva, the vice president of the European Commission, said that all the organization's institutions are at \"alert level orange\" and that all meetings on its premises and outside have been canceled.\nShe advised people to stay at home or indoors.\n\"I am shocked and concerned by the events in Brussels,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted. \"We will do everything we can to help.\"\nI am shocked and concerned by the events in Brussels. We will do everything we can to help.\n\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) March 22, 2016 Abdeslam, who authorities say was involved in the Paris terror attacks last year, was arrested in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek on Friday.\nBelgium's Prime Minister deflected a question about whether there's any link between Tuesday's bloodshed and Abdeslam's capture, saying it is too early to tell.\nHe said Tuesday that he had \"no information\" about who was responsible for the attack, adding that authorities will find that out, but right now their focus is on caring for the victims.\nBelgian national soccer team captain Vincent Kompany tweeted that he was \"horrified and revolted (that) innocent people (are) paying the price again,\" but he urged people not to encourage those wishing to lash out.\n\"We must reject hate and its preachers,\" Kompany said. \"... I wish for Brussels to act with dignity.\"\nFollow Joshua Berlinger on Twitter",

The Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, won't stop talking about them. Sanders has proudly adopted the label of a \"democratic socialist,\" and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American future. In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \"freedom\" means... they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity. Sen. Bernie Sanders At a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October, Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what \"democratic socialism\" means to him. \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway,\" Sanders said, \"and learn what they have accomplished for their working people.\" Read More A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST \"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\" \"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PST While the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system. \"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\" But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports. \"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%. But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are onlylightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net. Houses stretch along a canal in Copenhagen The recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world. Over the past few years, studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street Journal, the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actuallymore economic freedom than the United States. \"There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true,\" said Bo Lidegaard, the executive editor-in-chief of Politiken , one of Denmark's leading newspapers. \"If by socialist you mean regulated, restrictive, the individual is not free to do what she or he wants, that is not what we have here. We have a society where the individual is perhaps freer than any other society because the government is securing the social contract so comprehensively.\" In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \"socialist\"--even a \"democratic socialist\"--as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades. \"When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it's a little bit 1970s,\" said Lars Christensen, a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homeland's model. \"The major political parties on the center-leftand the center-rightwould oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\" Could the U.S. adopt the Danish model?
