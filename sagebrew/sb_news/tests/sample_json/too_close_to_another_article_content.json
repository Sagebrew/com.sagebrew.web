        "text": "Story highlights Police conduct raids around Brussels for people linked to the attacks, state broadcaster reports Authorities in New York, Washington, Chicago and L.A. step up patrols after Brussels attacks Two explosions ripped through the Brussels Airport, and another happened at a subway station Brussels, Belgium (CNN) Three explosions that ripped through the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday killed at least 34 people and wounded about 170 more, according to Belgian media, and raised the reality of terror once again in the heart of Europe.\n\"We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters.\nBelgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport.\nAfter the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks.\nCiting judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks.\nRead More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.\nBrussels under attack: Live updates\n20 photos: Terror attacks in Brussels An injured woman leaves the Brussels airport after at least two explosions rocked the facility Tuesday, March 22.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based.\nRichard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for.\n\"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\"\nYet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\"\nThat doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening.\n\"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\"\nEurope, U.S. on alert as well\nBelgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport.\nThis comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs.\nIn addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside.\nThe ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well.\nAs far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon.\nSimilar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe.\nEurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels.\nUPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station.\n\u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium.\n\"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\"\nBritish police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard.\n1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport.\n\u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\n\"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\"\n\"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\"\nAirport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down\nThe darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building.\n\"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN.\nBarrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded.\nIn the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\"\nCNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added.\n\"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\"\nTraveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint.\nHe says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways.\nSoccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity'\nAbout an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station.\nPeople wounded outside #maelbeek #metro #brussels @cnnireport #brusselsattacks #maalbeek pic.twitter.com/JaqUEOz7Tl\n\u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks.\n\"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\"\nJUST WATCHED Subway witness: We fled through smoke Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nSubway witness: We fled through smoke 01:36 The Belgian crisis center tweeted that all public transportation in the city has been closed.\n\"Stay where you are,\" it said.\nKristalina Georgieva, the vice president of the European Commission, said that all the organization's institutions are at \"alert level orange\" and that all meetings on its premises and outside have been canceled.\nShe advised people to stay at home or indoors.\n\"I am shocked and concerned by the events in Brussels,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted. \"We will do everything we can to help.\"\nI am shocked and concerned by the events in Brussels. We will do everything we can to help.\n\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) March 22, 2016 Abdeslam, who authorities say was involved in the Paris terror attacks last year, was arrested in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek on Friday.\nBelgium's Prime Minister deflected a question about whether there's any link between Tuesday's bloodshed and Abdeslam's capture, saying it is too early to tell.\nHe said Tuesday that he had \"no information\" about who was responsible for the attack, adding that authorities will find that out, but right now their focus is on caring for the victims.\nBelgian national soccer team captain Vincent Kompany tweeted that he was \"horrified and revolted (that) innocent people (are) paying the price again,\" but he urged people not to encourage those wishing to lash out.\n\"We must reject hate and its preachers,\" Kompany said. \"... I wish for Brussels to act with dignity.\"\nFollow Joshua Berlinger on Twitter",

Belgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport. After the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks. Citing judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks. Read More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based. Richard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for. \"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\" Yet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\" That doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening. \"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\" Europe, U.S. on alert as well Belgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport. This comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs. In addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside. The ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well. As far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon. Similar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe. Eurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels. UPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station. \u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium. \"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\" British police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard. 1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport. \u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve. \"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\" That sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\" \"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\" Airport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down The darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building. \"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN. Barrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded. In the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\" CNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added. \"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\" Traveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint. He says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways. Soccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity' About an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station. \u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks. \"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\" JUST WATCHED",

        "text": "Story highlights Police conduct raids around Brussels for people linked to the attacks, state broadcaster reports Authorities in New York, Washington, Chicago and L.A. step up patrols after Brussels attacks Two explosions ripped through the Brussels Airport, and another happened at a subway station Brussels, Belgium (CNN) Three explosions that ripped through the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday killed at least 34 people and wounded about 170 more, according to Belgian media, and raised the reality of terror once again in the heart of Europe.\n\"We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters.\nBelgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport.\nAfter the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks.\nCiting judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks.\nRead More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.\nBrussels under attack: Live updates\n20 photos: Terror attacks in Brussels An injured woman leaves the Brussels airport after at least two explosions rocked the facility Tuesday, March 22.

Belgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport. After the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks. Citing judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks. Read More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based. Richard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for. \"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\" Yet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\" That doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening. \"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\" Europe, U.S. on alert as well Belgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport. This comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs. In addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside. The ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well. As far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon. Similar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe. Eurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels. UPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station. \u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium. \"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\" British police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard. 1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport. \u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve. \"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\" That sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\" \"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\" Airport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down The darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building. \"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN. Barrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded. In the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\" CNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added. \"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\" Traveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint. He says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways. Soccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity' About an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station. \u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks. \"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\" JUST WATCHED",

The Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, won't stop talking about them. Sanders has proudly adopted the label of a \"democratic socialist,\" and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American future. In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \"freedom\" means... they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity. Sen. Bernie Sanders At a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October, Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what \"democratic socialism\" means to him. \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway,\" Sanders said, \"and learn what they have accomplished for their working people.\" Read More A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST \"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\" \"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PST While the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system. \"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\" But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports. \"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%. But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are onlylightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net. Houses stretch along a canal in Copenhagen The recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world. Over the past few years, studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street Journal, the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actuallymore economic freedom than the United States. \"There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true,\" said Bo Lidegaard, the executive editor-in-chief of Politiken , one of Denmark's leading newspapers. \"If by socialist you mean regulated, restrictive, the individual is not free to do what she or he wants, that is not what we have here. We have a society where the individual is perhaps freer than any other society because the government is securing the social contract so comprehensively.\" In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \"socialist\"--even a \"democratic socialist\"--as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades. \"When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it's a little bit 1970s,\" said Lars Christensen, a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homeland's model. \"The major political parties on the center-leftand the center-rightwould oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\" Could the U.S. adopt the Danish model?

The Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, won't stop talking about them. Sanders has proudly adopted the label of a \"democratic socialist,\" and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American future. In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \"freedom\" means... they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity. Sen. Bernie Sanders At a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October, Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what \"democratic socialism\" means to him. \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway,\" Sanders said, \"and learn what they have accomplished for their working people.\" Read More A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST \"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\" \"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PST While the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system. \"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\" But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports. \"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%. But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are onlylightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net. Houses stretch along a canal in Copenhagen The recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world. Over the past few years, studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street Journal, the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actuallymore economic freedom than the United States. \"There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true,\" said Bo Lidegaard, the executive editor-in-chief of Politiken , one of Denmark's leading newspapers. \"If by socialist you mean regulated, restrictive, the individual is not free to do what she or he wants, that is not what we have here. We have a society where the individual is perhaps freer than any other society because the government is securing the social contract so comprehensively.\" In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \"socialist\"--even a \"democratic socialist\"--as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades. \"When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it's a little bit 1970s,\" said Lars Christensen, a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homeland's model. \"The major political parties on the center-leftand the center-rightwould oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\" Could the U.S. adopt the Danish model?

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

Sam Brownback (R) cut taxes for the wealthy and eliminated income taxes for small businesses, saying it would be a \"real live experiment\" for conservative economic policies. \"That's a terrible sales pitch for something,\" Meyers quipped. \"Those words only usually show up in shady classified ads.\" Supporters said the cuts would somehow generate $323 million in new revenue, but they actually produced a $688 million loss, and the state got creative when it tried to close the gap, at one point taking adult items seized from a business that owed back taxes and auctioning them off online. \nNow, residents are complaining about budgets being slashed and business owners are rejecting the drastic tax cuts, leading Meyers to believe the results of the experiment are in. \"Republicans want to replicate these policies on a national level, but even when you buy couch cleaner they tell you to try it on a small patch of fabric first,\" he said. \"That's what happened here \u2014 Kansas was the small patch of fabric. Not only did the cleaner not work, the couch exploded.\" Watch the (in some parts racy) video below. Catherine Garcia \nSamantha Bee takes a moderate whack at GOP Supreme Court obstruction, and a poke at Joe Biden 2:14 a.m. ET \nEver since Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly, Senate Republicans \"have made it clear that they're going to hold the Supreme Court hostage like a Mexican housekeeper locking Richard Simmons up in the crawl space,\" Samantha Bee said on Monday's Full Frontal . President Obama \"fulfilled his constitutional duty to troll the Republicans soooo hard\" by naming a moderate nominee, Merrick Garland, that many of them had just lauded, Bee said, showing a clip of Fox News pundits freaking out over Obama's \"trap.\" But Senate Republicans were ready with some trolling of their own. \nTheir first gambit was repeating \"the Biden Rule\" ad nauseam to justify their court-blocking. \"Ah, yes, the Biden Rule that totally exists,\" Bee said. \"What is the Biden Rule again?\" After showing a brief clip of Biden saying something stupid, she rolled the video of him talking about judicial appointments \u2014 but she played all the relevant parts . \"Oh, so Color Me Bad\u2013era Biden said he'd support a moderate nominee from President Bush,\" Bee said. \"That's so great! If that's the rule, let's get on with moderate Merrick's hearing \u2014 tick tock, you don't stop.\" \nBut Republicans had a backup catch-phrase: Lame-duck Obama. \"He's not a lame duck \u2014 he's three trimesters away from from lame-duckery,\" Bee protested. \"A president's term is four years. You can't say only three of those are legitimate and the fourth is garbage \u2014 they're not Indiana Jones movies.\" Finally, she found one Republican senator, Jeff Flake (Ariz.), willing to consider confirming Garland, at least if Hillary Clinton wins. Bee took her poke at the vice president, and Flake: \"Oh, dude! Did you just embarrass your party by blurting out the thing you're not supposed to say in public? Finally, someone following the actual Biden Rule!\" Watch below.

He tried to get a meeting with Rubio before the Florida primary, which Rubio lost to Trump, but was rebuffed, Politico reports. Undeterred, Cruz's team spent the last week conducting polls in upcoming primary states to see how he would do running with Rubio, the sources said. If nothing else, Cruz's campaign would like a Rubio endorsement, and those close to Rubio say he's open to it, particularly if he thinks Cruz has a shot at beating Trump. \nOn Fox News Monday night, Cruz said he hasn't talked about a unity ticket with Rubio, but isn't ruling it out. \"I think any Republican would naturally have Marco on their short list and you would look seriously to him as a vice presidential choice,\" he said.
