    "text": "As Cuba Rises, Puerto Rico Falls 8 By James Gibney \nPresident Barack Obama dangles U.S. dollars before the Castros while Congress stonewalls Puerto Rico\u2019s pleas for debt restructuring. The Tampa Bay Rays take the field in Havana as San Juan fends off New York hedge funds wielding legal baseball bats. The Rolling Stones play a free concert for Cubans; Puerto Rico can\u2019t get no satisfaction. \nAs Cuba rises and Puerto Rico falls, it\u2019s worth considering the diverging trajectories of these two ex-Spanish colonies that the Puerto Rican poet Lola Rodr\u00edguez de Ti\u00f3 described more than 100 years ago as \u201ctwo wings of the same bird.\u201d Even as the resumption of diplomatic ties with the U.S. opens new possibilities for Cuba, Puerto Rico\u2019s current status as a U.S. commonwealth has turned into an ugly dead end. \nPuerto Rico is defaulting in slow motion on $70 billion worth of debt. Its economy has shrunk 9 of the past 10 years. A few hundred miles to the west, meanwhile, economic reforms are creating new livelihoods for self-employed Cubans, whose material conditions are improving. Buoyed by the arrival of new tourists, remittances, and foreign investments , Cuba\u2019s economy grew by 4 percent last year. \nAnd when the U.S. embargo is lifted, Cuba \u2013 which for much of the 19 th and 20 th centuries was the Caribbean\u2019s predominant economy -- is likely to take a growing bite out of Puerto Rico\u2019s fortunes, in tourism , manufacturing and services. And that's before accounting for Puerto Rico's existing fiscal straits, which will lead to shrinking government services, higher costs imposed by utilities under siege from creditors and a string of broken social promises and busted pensions. \nTrue, Cubans don\u2019t have democracy. Then again, at the national level, neither do Puerto Ricans: Despite being U.S. citizens, they can't vote for president or in Congress, which these days mostly ignores them. Cubans may face the threat of arbitrary detention and abuse. But they\u2019re much less likely than Puerto Ricans to be shot dead on the street, or to be victimized by drug traffickers or other criminals. \nIn fact, by many other yardsticks, you\u2019re better off being born in Cuba than Puerto Rico. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at the World Factbook put out by those raving socialists at the Central Intelligence Agency. Lower infant mortality? Check! Same with lower unemployment, higher literacy, and a lower overall death rate. \nThings weren\u2019t supposed to turn out this way for the island that President John F. Kennedy touted three months after the Bay of Pigs invasion as \u201ca source of hope and inspiration to those of us deeply concerned with charting new courses of social progress for our Hemisphere.\u201d \nPuerto Rico's Slide \nThe proximate cause of Puerto Rico\u2019s current distress is its crushing debt, which has tripled since 2000. And yes, irresponsible and corrupt legislators and executives (and the voters who elect them) deserve much of the blame. \nBut the larger problem has been Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with its federal overlords, who have oscillated between patronizing micromanagement and malign neglect -- devising ill-suited development strategies, granting and then revoking economic benefits, imposing regulations that undermined the island\u2019s competitiveness and creating disincentives for work. \nConsider the Washington-backed effort to turn Puerto Rico into a manufacturing hub. During the late 1940s, U.S. companies were given federal and local tax breaks to locate on the island. But U.S. minimum wage laws and trade agreements with other nations gradually eroded Puerto Rico's competitive advantages. Moreover, instead of investing in the island, U.S. companies brought their profits back to the mainland. \nIn 1976, the U.S. tried again, sweetening the pot for companies with Section 936 of the Federal Tax Reform Act. That created new jobs in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and electronics, but at huge fiscal cost as mainland corporations gamed tax laws. When the U.S. phased out the tax breaks, the island's manufacturing employment took a big hit -- a blow that Puerto Rico's legislators are quick to blame for the island's decline, not least because it conveniently absolves them for their own bad decisions. \nThe Republican-controlled U.S. Congress is now debating what to do about Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal mess. The island's top officials have all but begged for the ability to restructure the debt of its municipalities under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code \u2013 a power Puerto Rico had for decades until Congress took it away . Better yet would be the ability also to restructure its general obligation debt, which it can\u2019t realistically pay. \nCongress seems unlikely to allow restructuring. Instead, the Republican majority wants to impose a fiscal control board that takes over Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs. Analysts at Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for a New Economy have argued against this approach's \"colonial and imperialistic overtones,\" which also contradict the GOP's devolutionary, small-government philosophy. Instead, they advocate passing a \"fiscal responsibility law\" with strict enforcement provisions. \nAs smart as this idea looks on paper, the island\u2019s repeated failures to put its own fiscal house in order undermine that case. On the other hand, imposing a control board without granting debt relief risks accelerating Puerto Rico\u2019s downward spiral. \nThat brings us back to the central question of Puerto Rico\u2019s sovereignty. A control board for Puerto Rico would be all-too-consistent with its quasi-colonial status: Its legislators and executives behave irresponsibly in part because the buck doesn't stop with them. The island depends on the federal government for a quarter of its revenues, on terms that Washington sets, while it's straightjacketed by federal regulations that hurt its competitiveness and estrange it from neighboring economies. \nMaking Puerto Rico a state wouldn't necessarily cure it of bad fiscal behavior (see: Illinois). And independence would bring huge challenges. But remaining a commonwealth isn't working either. More than a half-century after JFK called Puerto Rico a \"source of hope and inspiration,\" its predicament should be a source of shame for every American. Its U.S. citizens have rates of poverty and unemployment that dwarf those on the mainland, and diminishing prospects that make a mock of the American Dream. They don't even enjoy the full benefits of the U.S. Constitution. \nTheir lot won't fundamentally improve until they seize control of their own destiny and choose between statehood or independence. And when they finally make that choice, Congress should honor it, either welcoming Puerto Rico as the 51 st state or allowing it to be independent. \nOnce Cuba gained its independence from U.S. control in 1902, it became theoretically free to make its own mistakes, notwithstanding the colossus to the north looking over its shoulder. And Lord knows Cuba made plenty of them, even before its current detour through socialist privation and repression. Over the years, Cuba has nonetheless delighted in tweaking Uncle Sam in the United Nations over Puerto Rico\u2019s \"colonial\" status, and is doubtless enjoying some quiet schadenfreude over its neighbor's troubles. \nYet these two islands can lift each other up. In addition to their shared history and culture, they face some similar demographic and economic challenges, and have some complementary strengths -- Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry and Cuba's nascent biotechnology sector, for instance. An unlikely partnership, perhaps. But as President Obama has noted about Cuban policy, we know what hasn't worked. Maybe it's time to try something different for Puerto Rico too.

    "text": "\u2018Blood Year\u2019 by David Kilcullen \nThis is the land of Isis , the jihadi organisation in control of swaths of Syrian and Iraqi territory. The trade in oil has been declared a prime target by the international military coalition fighting the group. And yet it goes on, undisturbed. \nOil is the black gold that funds Isis\u2019 black flag \u2014 it fuels its war machine, provides electricity and gives the fanatical jihadis critical leverage against their neighbours. \nBut more than a year after US President Barack Obama launched an international coalition to fight Isis, the bustling trade at al-Omar and at least eight other fields has come to symbolise the dilemma the campaign faces: how to bring down the \u201ccaliphate\u201d without destabilising the life of the estimated 10m civilians in areas under Isis control, and punishing the west\u2019s allies? \nThe resilience of Isis, and the weakness of the US-led campaign, have given Russia a pretext to launch its own, bold intervention in Syria. \nDespite all these efforts, dozens of interviews with Syrian traders and oil engineers as well as western intelligence officials and oil experts reveal a sprawling operation almost akin to a state oil company that has grown in size and expertise despite international attempts to destroy it. \nMinutely managed, Isis\u2019 oil company actively recruits skilled workers, from engineers to trainers and managers. \nEstimates by local traders and engineers put crude production in Isis-held territory at about 34,000-40,000 bpd. The oil is sold at the wellhead for between $20 and $45 a barrel, earning the militants an average of $1.5m a day. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that makes you laugh and cry,\u201d said one Syrian rebel commander in Aleppo, who buys diesel from Isis areas even as his forces fight the group on the front lines. \u201cBut we have no other choice, and we are a poor man\u2019s revolution. Is anyone else offering to give us fuel?\u201d Oil as a strategic weapon \nIsis\u2019 oil strategy has been long in the making. Since the group emerged on the scene in Syria in 2013, long before they reached Mosul in Iraq, the jihadis saw oil as a crutch for their vision for an Islamic state. The group\u2019s shura council identified it as fundamental for the survival of the insurgency and, more importantly, to finance their ambition to create a caliphate. Journey with a barrel of Isis oil \nSelling crude is Isis\u2019 biggest single source of revenue. \nFollow the progress of a barrel of oil from extraction to end user to see how the Isis production system works, who is making money from it, and why it is proving so challenging to disrupt \nView graphic \nMost of the oil Isis controls is in Syria\u2019s oil-rich east, where it created a foothold in 2013, shortly after withdrawing from the north-west \u2014 an area of strategic importance but with no oil. These bridgeheads were then used to consolidate control over the whole of eastern Syria after the fall of Mosul in 2014. \nWhen it pushed through northern Iraq and took over Mosul, Isis also seized the Ajil and Allas fields in north-eastern Iraq\u2019s Kirkuk province. The very day of its takeover, locals say, militants secured the fields and engineers were sent in to begin operations and ship the oil to market. \n\u201cThey were ready, they had people there in charge of the financial side, they had technicians that adjusted the filling and storage process,\u201d said a local sheikh from the town of Hawija, near Kirkuk. \u201cThey brought hundreds of trucks in from Kirkuk and Mosul and they started to extract the oil and export it.\u201d An average of 150 trucks, he added, were filled daily, with each containing about $10,000-worth of oil. Isis lost the fields to the Iraqi army in April but made an estimated $450m from them in the 10 months it controlled the area. \nWhile al-Qaeda, the global terrorist network, depended on donations from wealthy foreign sponsors, Isis has derived its financial strength from its status as monopoly producer of an essential commodity consumed in vast quantities throughout the area it controls. Even without being able to export, it can thrive because it has a huge captive market in Syria and Iraq. \nIndeed, diesel and petrol produced in Isis areas are not only consumed in territory the group controls but in areas that are technically at war with it, such as Syria \u2019s rebel-held north: the region is dependent on the jihadis\u2019 fuel for its survival. Hospitals, shops, tractors and machinery used to pull victims out of rubble run on generators that are powered by Isis oil. \n\u201cAt any moment, the diesel can be cut. No diesel \u2014 Isis knows our life is completely dead,\u201d says one oil trader who comes from rebel-held Aleppo each week to buy fuel and spoke to the Financial Times by telephone. A national oil company \nIsis\u2019 strategy has rested on projecting the image of a state in the making, and it is attempting to run its oil industry by mimicking the ways of national oil corporations. According to Syrians who say Isis tried to recruit them, the group headhunts engineers, offering competitive salaries to those with the requisite experience, and encourages prospective employees to apply to its human resources department. \nA roving committee of its specialists checks up on fields, monitors production and interviews workers about operations. It also appoints Isis members who have worked at oil companies in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Middle East as \u201cemirs\u201d, or princes, to run its most important facilities, say traders who buy Isis oil and engineers who have worked at Isis-controlled fields. \nSome technicians have been actively courted by Isis recruiters. Rami \u2014 not his real name \u2014 used to work in oil in Syria\u2019s Deir Ezzor province before becoming a rebel commander. He was later contacted by an Isis military emir in Iraq via WhatsApp. \n\u201cI could choose whatever position I wanted, he promised me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said: \u2018You can name your salary\u2019.\u201d Sceptical of the Isis project, Rami ultimately turned down the offer and fled to Turkey. \nIsis also recruits from among its supporters abroad. In the speech he gave after the fall of Mosul, Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called not only for fighters but engineers, doctors and other skilled labour. The group recently appointed an Egyptian engineer who used to live in Sweden as the new manager of its Qayyara refinery in northern Iraq, according to an Iraqi petroleum engineer from Mosul, who declined to be named. \nThe central role of oil is also reflected in the status it is given in Isis\u2019 power structures. \nThe group\u2019s approach to government across the territories it controls is highly decentralised. For the most part, it relies on regional walis \u2014 governors \u2014 to administer territories according to the precepts laid down by the central shura. \nHowever, oil \u2014 alongside Isis\u2019 military and security operations and its sophisticated media output \u2014 is centrally controlled by the top leadership. \u201cThey are organised in their approach to oil,\u201d said a senior western intelligence official. \u201cThat\u2019s a key centrally controlled and documented area. It\u2019s a central shura matter,\u201d he added, referring to Isis\u2019 ruling \u201ccabinet\u201d. \nUntil recently, Isis\u2019 emir for oil was Abu Sayyaf, a Tunisian whose real name, according to the Pentagon, was Fathi Ben Awn Ben Jildi Murad al-Tunisi, and who was killed by US special forces in a raid in May this year. According to US and European intelligence officials, a treasure trove of documentation relating to Isis\u2019 oil operations was found with him. The documents laid bare a meticulously run operation, with revenues from wells and costs carefully accounted for. They showed a pragmatic approach to pricing too, with Isis carefully exploiting differences in demand across its territories to maximise profitability. \nOversight of the oil wells is carefully controlled by the Amniyat , Isis\u2019 secret police, who ensure revenues go where they should \u2014 and mete out brutal punishments when they do not. Guards patrol the perimeter of pumping stations, while far-flung individual wells are surrounded by protective sand berms and each trader is carefully checked as he drives in to fill up. \nAt the al-Jibssa field in Hassakeh province, north-eastern Syria, which produces 2,500-3,000 bpd, \u201cabout 30-40 big trucks a day, each with 75 barrels of capacity, would fill up\u201d, according to one Hassakeh oil trader. Isis\u2019 distribution network \nBut the biggest draw is al-Omar. According to one trader who regularly buys oil there, the system, with its 6km queue, is slow but market players have adapted to it. Drivers present a document with their licence plate number and tanker capacity to Isis officials, who enter them into a database and assign them a number. \nMost then return to their villages, shuttling back to the site every two or three days to check up on their vehicles. Traders say that towards the end of the month, some people come back and set up tents to stay close to their trucks while they wait their turn. \nOnce in possession of al-Omar\u2019s oil, the traders either take it to local refineries or sell it on at a mark-up to middlemen with smaller vehicles who transport it to cities further west such as Aleppo and Idlib. \nIsis\u2019 luck with oil may not last. Coalition bombs, the Russian intervention and low oil prices could put pressure on revenues. The biggest threat to Isis\u2019 production so far, however, has been the depletion of Syria\u2019s ageing oilfields. It does not have the technology of major foreign companies to counteract what locals describe as a slow drop in production. Isis\u2019 need for fuel for its military operations means there is also less oil to sell in the market. \nFor now, though, in Isis-controlled territory, the jihadis control the supply and there is no shortage of demand. \u201cEveryone here needs diesel: for water, for farming, for hospitals, for offices. If diesel is cut off, there is no life here,\u201d says a businessman who works near Aleppo. \u201cIsis knows this [oil] is a winning card.\u201d \nAdditional reporting by Ahmad Mhidi, an independent journalist based on the Turkish border and Geoff Dyer in Washington Related Topics ",
