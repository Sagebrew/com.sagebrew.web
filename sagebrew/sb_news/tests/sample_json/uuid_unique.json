    "text": "As Cuba Rises, Puerto Rico Falls 8 By James Gibney \nPresident Barack Obama dangles U.S. dollars before the Castros while Congress stonewalls Puerto Rico\u2019s pleas for debt restructuring. The Tampa Bay Rays take the field in Havana as San Juan fends off New York hedge funds wielding legal baseball bats. The Rolling Stones play a free concert for Cubans; Puerto Rico can\u2019t get no satisfaction. \nAs Cuba rises and Puerto Rico falls, it\u2019s worth considering the diverging trajectories of these two ex-Spanish colonies that the Puerto Rican poet Lola Rodr\u00edguez de Ti\u00f3 described more than 100 years ago as \u201ctwo wings of the same bird.\u201d Even as the resumption of diplomatic ties with the U.S. opens new possibilities for Cuba, Puerto Rico\u2019s current status as a U.S. commonwealth has turned into an ugly dead end. \nPuerto Rico is defaulting in slow motion on $70 billion worth of debt. Its economy has shrunk 9 of the past 10 years. A few hundred miles to the west, meanwhile, economic reforms are creating new livelihoods for self-employed Cubans, whose material conditions are improving. Buoyed by the arrival of new tourists, remittances, and foreign investments , Cuba\u2019s economy grew by 4 percent last year. \nAnd when the U.S. embargo is lifted, Cuba \u2013 which for much of the 19 th and 20 th centuries was the Caribbean\u2019s predominant economy -- is likely to take a growing bite out of Puerto Rico\u2019s fortunes, in tourism , manufacturing and services. And that's before accounting for Puerto Rico's existing fiscal straits, which will lead to shrinking government services, higher costs imposed by utilities under siege from creditors and a string of broken social promises and busted pensions. \nTrue, Cubans don\u2019t have democracy. Then again, at the national level, neither do Puerto Ricans: Despite being U.S. citizens, they can't vote for president or in Congress, which these days mostly ignores them. Cubans may face the threat of arbitrary detention and abuse. But they\u2019re much less likely than Puerto Ricans to be shot dead on the street, or to be victimized by drug traffickers or other criminals. \nIn fact, by many other yardsticks, you\u2019re better off being born in Cuba than Puerto Rico. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at the World Factbook put out by those raving socialists at the Central Intelligence Agency. Lower infant mortality? Check! Same with lower unemployment, higher literacy, and a lower overall death rate. \nThings weren\u2019t supposed to turn out this way for the island that President John F. Kennedy touted three months after the Bay of Pigs invasion as \u201ca source of hope and inspiration to those of us deeply concerned with charting new courses of social progress for our Hemisphere.\u201d \nPuerto Rico's Slide \nThe proximate cause of Puerto Rico\u2019s current distress is its crushing debt, which has tripled since 2000. And yes, irresponsible and corrupt legislators and executives (and the voters who elect them) deserve much of the blame. \nBut the larger problem has been Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with its federal overlords, who have oscillated between patronizing micromanagement and malign neglect -- devising ill-suited development strategies, granting and then revoking economic benefits, imposing regulations that undermined the island\u2019s competitiveness and creating disincentives for work. \nConsider the Washington-backed effort to turn Puerto Rico into a manufacturing hub. During the late 1940s, U.S. companies were given federal and local tax breaks to locate on the island. But U.S. minimum wage laws and trade agreements with other nations gradually eroded Puerto Rico's competitive advantages. Moreover, instead of investing in the island, U.S. companies brought their profits back to the mainland. \nIn 1976, the U.S. tried again, sweetening the pot for companies with Section 936 of the Federal Tax Reform Act. That created new jobs in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and electronics, but at huge fiscal cost as mainland corporations gamed tax laws. When the U.S. phased out the tax breaks, the island's manufacturing employment took a big hit -- a blow that Puerto Rico's legislators are quick to blame for the island's decline, not least because it conveniently absolves them for their own bad decisions. \nThe Republican-controlled U.S. Congress is now debating what to do about Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal mess. The island's top officials have all but begged for the ability to restructure the debt of its municipalities under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code \u2013 a power Puerto Rico had for decades until Congress took it away . Better yet would be the ability also to restructure its general obligation debt, which it can\u2019t realistically pay. \nCongress seems unlikely to allow restructuring. Instead, the Republican majority wants to impose a fiscal control board that takes over Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs. Analysts at Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for a New Economy have argued against this approach's \"colonial and imperialistic overtones,\" which also contradict the GOP's devolutionary, small-government philosophy. Instead, they advocate passing a \"fiscal responsibility law\" with strict enforcement provisions. \nAs smart as this idea looks on paper, the island\u2019s repeated failures to put its own fiscal house in order undermine that case. On the other hand, imposing a control board without granting debt relief risks accelerating Puerto Rico\u2019s downward spiral. \nThat brings us back to the central question of Puerto Rico\u2019s sovereignty. A control board for Puerto Rico would be all-too-consistent with its quasi-colonial status: Its legislators and executives behave irresponsibly in part because the buck doesn't stop with them. The island depends on the federal government for a quarter of its revenues, on terms that Washington sets, while it's straightjacketed by federal regulations that hurt its competitiveness and estrange it from neighboring economies. \nMaking Puerto Rico a state wouldn't necessarily cure it of bad fiscal behavior (see: Illinois). And independence would bring huge challenges. But remaining a commonwealth isn't working either. More than a half-century after JFK called Puerto Rico a \"source of hope and inspiration,\" its predicament should be a source of shame for every American. Its U.S. citizens have rates of poverty and unemployment that dwarf those on the mainland, and diminishing prospects that make a mock of the American Dream. They don't even enjoy the full benefits of the U.S. Constitution. \nTheir lot won't fundamentally improve until they seize control of their own destiny and choose between statehood or independence. And when they finally make that choice, Congress should honor it, either welcoming Puerto Rico as the 51 st state or allowing it to be independent. \nOnce Cuba gained its independence from U.S. control in 1902, it became theoretically free to make its own mistakes, notwithstanding the colossus to the north looking over its shoulder. And Lord knows Cuba made plenty of them, even before its current detour through socialist privation and repression. Over the years, Cuba has nonetheless delighted in tweaking Uncle Sam in the United Nations over Puerto Rico\u2019s \"colonial\" status, and is doubtless enjoying some quiet schadenfreude over its neighbor's troubles. \nYet these two islands can lift each other up. In addition to their shared history and culture, they face some similar demographic and economic challenges, and have some complementary strengths -- Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry and Cuba's nascent biotechnology sector, for instance. An unlikely partnership, perhaps. But as President Obama has noted about Cuban policy, we know what hasn't worked. Maybe it's time to try something different for Puerto Rico too.

The Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, won't stop talking about them. Sanders has proudly adopted the label of a \"democratic socialist,\" and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American future. In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \"freedom\" means... they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity. Sen. Bernie Sanders At a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October, Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what \"democratic socialism\" means to him. \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway,\" Sanders said, \"and learn what they have accomplished for their working people.\" Read More A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST \"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\" \"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PST While the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system. \"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\" But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports. \"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%. But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are onlylightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net. Houses stretch along a canal in Copenhagen The recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world. Over the past few years, studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street Journal, the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actuallymore economic freedom than the United States. \"There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true,\" said Bo Lidegaard, the executive editor-in-chief of Politiken , one of Denmark's leading newspapers. \"If by socialist you mean regulated, restrictive, the individual is not free to do what she or he wants, that is not what we have here. We have a society where the individual is perhaps freer than any other society because the government is securing the social contract so comprehensively.\" In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \"socialist\"--even a \"democratic socialist\"--as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades. \"When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it's a little bit 1970s,\" said Lars Christensen, a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homeland's model. \"The major political parties on the center-leftand the center-rightwould oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\" Could the U.S. adopt the Danish model?

The Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, won't stop talking about them. Sanders has proudly adopted the label of a \"democratic socialist,\" and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American future. In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \"freedom\" means... they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity. Sen. Bernie Sanders At a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October, Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what \"democratic socialism\" means to him. \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway,\" Sanders said, \"and learn what they have accomplished for their working people.\" Read More A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST \"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\" \"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PST While the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system. \"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\" But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports. \"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%. But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are onlylightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net.
