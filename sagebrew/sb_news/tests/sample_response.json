      "text": "Story highlights The Republican candidates for president gathered in Houston Thursday for their last debate before Super Tuesday A team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated Washington (CNN) The Republican candidates for president gathered in Houston on Thursday for their last debate before Super Tuesday, and CNN's Reality Check Team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated. Donald Trump Reality Check: Trump on American taxes By Kate Grise and Tami Luhby, CNN Read More Donald Trump reprised a claim he's made in past debates, saying the United States is the \"highest taxed country in the world.\" Responding to a question about his plan to cut taxes, Trump said, \"If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.\" As CNN's Reality Check team did when Trump made this claim two weeks ago, we'll look at each part of his claim that American individuals and businesses pay more taxes than any other country. So, do Americans really pay more individual taxes than citizens of any other country in the world? Hardly. America ranked 17 out of 34 Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development member countries for total tax revenue per capita in 2014. In America, the tax revenue per capita is $14,203.90. In Luxembourg, the country with the highest tax revenue per capita, that rate is almost $50,000. Norway's tax revenue per capita hits more than $38,000. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland round out the top five countries with the highest tax revenue per capita. OECD's 34 member countries are advanced, industrialized nations, which makes their data valuable in comparing the United States to similar countries. China, Russia and India are not included in the OECD's list because they are not member countries. We can also look at total tax revenue as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product. This time, America ranks even lower -- 27th out of 34 OECD member countries in 2014. America's tax revenue is 26% of the country's GDP. Denmark tops the list, with its tax revenue being equal to 50% of the country's GDP. Looking at whether American citizens face the highest taxes, we rate Trump's claim as false . Turning to companies, it's true that American businesses face the highest official corporate tax rate. The federal rate stands at 35%. But that's not what many companies actually pay. The Government Accountability Office found that large, profitable U.S. corporations paid an average effective federal tax rate of 12.6% in 2010 , thanks to things like tax credits, exemptions and offshore tax havens. U.S. corporate tax collection totaled 2.6% of GDP in 2011, according to the OECD. That was the 11th lowest in a ranking of 27 wealthy nations. So when it comes to American corporations, we rate Trump's statement as true, but misleading . The United States has the highest official corporate tax rate, but that's not what many companies actually pay. Reality Check: Trump has a dirty mouth By Sonam Vashi, CNN Asked about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's comments from earlier Thursday ( \"I'm not going to pay for that f**king wall!\" ), Trump said, \"I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been a national scandal. This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television and he should be ashamed of himself and he should apologize, OK?\" However, the businessman has a history that shows his own mouth might need to be washed out with soap. Cover your ears, children. In April 2011, he blasphemed at a large Las Vegas rally on oil prices (\"We have nobody in Washington that sits back and said, 'You're not going to raise that f***king price!'\"), on putting tariffs on China (\"Listen, you mother***kers, we're going to tax you 25%!\") and on military presence abroad (\"We build a school, we build a road, they blow up the school, we build another school, we build another road they blow them up, we build again, in the meantime we can't get a f***king school in Brooklyn.\"). Listen for yourself in the (bleeped) Vine below. That's not even counting the profanity he's uttered during this campaign season. Whether it's wanting to \"bomb the s**t out of\" ISIS , calling Cruz a \"pussy,\" or casually cursing during interviews , Trump's indignation over Fox's expletive seems a bit feigned when it comes to his own history. We rate Trump's outrage as %$*# . Reality Check: Trump on paying for the wall with Mexico By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Trump has long said he wants to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and get the Mexican government to pay for it. More recently, he's been tying the issue to America's trade deficit with its southern neighbor. \"We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country. We are going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion,\" Trump said. It's true that the trade deficit with Mexico was $58 billion last year. But that doesn't mean the Mexican government can pay for the wall ... not to mention whether they'd even agree to. The deficit means that private firms in Mexico have earned more money from trading with the U.S. than U.S. firms have earned from trade with Mexico, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"It not like it's a pot of money available to the Mexican government,\" he said. So it's false that the trade deficit gives Mexico the money to pay for the wall. CNN also looked at the cost of building the wall . Construction experts said a wall fashioned out of pre-casted concrete panels -- similar to those that run alongside highways -- would be the most workable choice. Based on the price of highway panels, the price tag for the wall alone would cost around $10 billion, which is not accounting for the cost of construction that would take at least four years over the border's diverse terrain. Other construction estimates have come in much higher. A retired estimator and economist for one of the nation's largest construction firms calculated it would cost nearly $25 billion, according to The Washington Post. We rate Trump's claim that building the wall would cost between $10 billion and $12 billion as false . Reality Check: Trump accidentally calls himself out By Amy Gallagher and Chad Weaver, CNN Trump said, \"I don't repeat myself. I don't repeat myself.\" But by our count, he repeated himself at least 20 times during the debate. Some examples: \"Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We'll be dynamic again.\" \"We will have a dynamic economy again.\" \"We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.\" \"We have the highest taxes in the world.\" \"I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands ...\" \"Let me talk. I've hired tens of thousands of people.\" \"And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You've hired nobody.\" We rate his claim false . False . Reality Check: Trump on \"Israeli Day Parade\" By Lisa Rose, CNN Trump touted his bona fides as a supporter of Israel during the debate, sparring with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz over which one of them is a more devoted booster of America's close ally. Trump said, \"I was the grand marshal, (walking) down Fifth Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade.\" And Trump added, \"I received their Tree of Life award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.\" The real estate tycoon indeed marched in a parade called Salute to Israel in 2004. The New York Daily News reported that Trump was heckled by pro-Palestine activists chanting, \"You're fired.\" Trump said he has close ties with the nation he has yet to visit as a candidate. He was scheduled to go there in December but canceled the trip after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized him for proposing a travel ban on Muslims in the wake of the San Bernardino attack. The Tree of Life prize is awarded by the Jewish National Fund, a charity that supports environmental initiatives and land development in Israel. A number of Jewish organizations have honored Trump over the years for his philanthropy, but the government of Israel has not yet given him a prize as he claimed Thursday. Verdict: True, but misleading . Reality Check: Cruz on Wall Street Journal article on Arizona immigration By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney In a heated debate about illegal immigration, Cruz noted that undocumented workers fled Arizona after the state cracked down on them. He cited a Wall Street Journal story that outlined the impact on state and business spending. \"What the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, on education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars, and the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants, who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop, are seeing wages rise,\" Cruz said. The number of undocumented workers in Arizona dropped by 40% between 2007 and 2012, the Journal writes, citing a Pew Research Center report. Here's what the Journal article actually said about the economic impact of that decline: -- The number of students enrolled in intensive English courses in Arizona public schools fell from 150,000 in 2008 to 70,000 in 2012 and has remained constant since. Schooling 80,000 fewer students would save the state roughly $350 million a year, by one measure. -- Annual emergency-room spending on non-citizens fell 37% from $167 million to $106 million. -- The annual cost to state prisons of incarcerating non-citizens convicted of felonies fell 11% from $202 million to $180 million. -- Wages rose about 15% for Arizona farmworkers and about 10% for construction between 2010 and 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's true that the Journal story said that spending on education dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. But Cruz exaggerates the other claims, so we rate them as false . The savings from fewer incarcerations are much smaller and the Journal doesn't mention welfare spending. In fact, it notes that undocumented immigrants cannot receive government benefits, including non-emergency hospital care. Also, while wages have gone up, the story doesn't specify whether pay is rising for legal immigrants. It noted that some of the low-skilled workers who benefited are native born. Reality Check: Cruz on everyone's illegal immigration records By Kate Grise, CNN Cruz kicked off the debate by defending his own record on illegal immigration and attacking others on stage. He made many claims about his record and those of two of the other candidates on stage with him. Let's look at them one by one. \"I really find it amazing that Donald believes he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you that when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall,\" Cruz said. During the race for his Senate race in 2012, Cruz said he opposed amnesty -- which to him means no pathway to citizenship or legal status for undocumented immigrants -- multiple times. \"Neither party is serious about stopping it. I strongly oppose illegal immigration. I categorically oppose amnesty. I support legal immigrants who come here supporting the American Dream,\" Cruz said in an interview with Hot Air in May 2012. In the same interview, Cruz said, \"We need to do everything humanly possible to secure the borders. Electronic surveillance, a wall, helicopters and, most importantly, boots on the ground.\" We rate Cruz's claim that he campaigned on a promise to fight amnesty and build a wall as true . Reality Check: Cruz says Trump is for 'socialized medicine' By Chip Grabow, CNN On the topic of health care, Cruz claimed Trump \"for decades ... has been advocating 'socialized medicine.' What he's said is that the government should pay for everyone's health care. And, in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.\" Cruz may be confusing \"universal health care\" with \"socialized medicine,\" two different things. The former means that everyone gets coverage. Socialized medicine means medicine and hospital services are paid for by taxes. And while we haven't found a record of Trump saying this during a debate, on ABC's \"This Week\" last month, he did allude to Cruz being heartless. Host George Stephanopoulos reminded Trump that Cruz was telling voters, \"A vote for Trump is a vote for Obamacare.\" Trump responded, \"I want people taken care of. I have a heart. I want people taken care of. If people have no money, we have to help people.\" Trump went on, saying of Cruz, \"Maybe he's got no heart.\" We did discover multiple instances as far back as 1999 where Trump has made clear his support of universal healthcare. Here's a few of them: Last September, in an interview on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Trump told Scott Pelley: \"I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.\" Pelley: \"The uninsured person is going to be taken care of. How? How?\" Trump: \"They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably --\" Pelley: \"Make a deal? Who pays for it?\" Trump: \"The government's gonna pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most, it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.\" Trump also spoke highly of universal health care in his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" where he wrote: \"We must have universal health care ... I'm a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one ... We need, as a nation, to re-examine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\" In 1999, Trump flirted with a presidential run as a Reform Party candidate. That year, he told CNN's Larry King: \"If you can't take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it's all over. ... I believe in universal health care.\" Trump may have an out for some of his claims -- he's often added that, while it's worked well in other countries like Scotland or Canada, he didn't think it would work as well in the U.S. While specific details are hard to come by regarding Trump's health care policies, he has made clear his support of universal health care, but not socialized medicine as Cruz claims. Verdict: False . Donald Trump and Ted Cruz Reality Check: Cruz and Trump on Libya intervention By Jamie Crawford, CNN In a discussion about the 2011 military intervention in Libya by the United States and its international allies, Cruz and Trump engaged in a vigorous debate about Trump's stance on the issue and the question of whether Libya was better off without Moammar Gadhafi in power. Trump said the following about Cruz: \"He's saying I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.\" In fact, Trump did speak out about the intervention in Libya in 2011 and the fate of Gadhafi. \"I can't believe what our country is doing,\" said Trump on a video blog of his in 2011. \"Gadhafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we're sitting around, we have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we're not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that's what it is: It's a carnage.\" Trump went further in the same remarks, saying that Gadhafi's ouster would be best for Libya. \"Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don't want to get involved and you're gonna end up with something like you've never seen before,\" Trump said at the time. Trump appeared to be calling for a military intervention in Libya and for Gadhafi's ouster in his 2011 remarks, which are at odds with his statement at the debate that the country would be better off with Gadhafi in power. We rate his statement Thursday night as false . In his remarks at the debate, Cruz said the following: \"He stated that in an interview that will be on our website, TedCruz.org, and you can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, that I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.\" Cruz's website does indeed link to the same 2011 video, so we rate his remarks as true . Donald Trump and John Kasich Reality Check: Trump and Kasich on fracking and jobs By Marshall Cohen and Sandee LaMotte, CNN Trump said of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, \"I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor -- but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Ohio a lot.\" Kasich replied, \"OK, let me just talk about that. Donald believes the energy industry is important and so do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.\" We checked a similar claim Trump made during a debate last October. Fracking first took off in Ohio four years ago. Since then, it has attracted more than $22 billion in investments to the state and the industry estimated that it would create 200,000 jobs. However, independent analysts concluded that job growth has not been nearly as robust as first predicted. IHS Global Insight, an economic analysis company, attributed the improving economy in Ohio to the fact that the manufacturing industry was expanding and that the population was growing slowly. They determined that the auto and plastics industries were the main drivers of growth -- not fracking. We rate Trump's claim as false . As for Kasich's response, we've fact-checked the 400,000 jobs figure before and found it to be true for private sector jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Marco Rubio Reality Check: Rubio says Obamacare is a certified job-killer By Tami Luhby and Kate Grise, CNN Florida Sen. Marco Rubio repeated his claim that Obamacare is \"a certified job-killer.\" \"It's bad for our economy,\" Rubio said. \"It's a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. It's not just a bad health care law, it's a job-killing law, and I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.\" In fact, Obamacare is not a job killer, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September. The report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. An ADP Research Institute study had similar findings. In fact, that study showed that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage. One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs. As to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers. Verdict: False . Reality Check: Rubio on Trump hiring undocumented workers By Sonam Vashi, CNN A fiery back-and-forth between Rubio and Trump elicited this lengthy exchange: Rubio: \"You're the only person on this stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.\" Trump: \"No, no, I'm the only one at this stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anybody.\" Rubio: \"In fact, some of the people --\" Trump: \"And by the way -- I've hired tens of thousands of people over my job. You've hired nobody. You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera.\" Rubio: \"Let me say --\" Trump: \"You haven't hired one person, you liar.\" Rubio: \"He hired workers from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars.\" Trump: \"That's wrong. Totally wrong.\" Rubio: \"People can look it up. I'm sure people are Googling right now. 'Trump Polish workers.' You'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it. That happened.\" And so on. We Googled \"Trump Polish workers\" and here's what we found. In 1980, a contracting company called Kaszycki & Sons Contractors hired a group of undocumented Polish immigrants to demolish a building that would later make room for the Trump Tower in Manhattan. Some of the workers were paid $4 an hour, working 12-hour shifts, and some of the workers never received the wages owed to them, according to litigation cited by The New York Times . In 1983, Trump was sued on the workers' behalf, involving allegations that he used undocumented Polish workers to avoid paying union medical and pension benefits. Trump denied ever knowing that the workers were undocumented, since the hiring was made by the contracting company. In 1991, a judge ruled that Trump conspired with the union president \"to withhold payments to the funds\" and owed more than $325,000. That ruling was appealed, and the prosecutor in the case estimated that the money owed could reach about $4 million, according to the Times . The case was eventually settled out of court in 1999, and the amount paid was unclear. We're not sure where Rubio got his $1 million figure from, but the final figure that Trump paid out was never made public. Additionally, The Washington Post reported last summer that a Trump company may have been employing some undocumented workers to construct a new hotel in downtown Washington, D.C. We're going to rate Rubio mostly true on his claim that Trump was fined for illegally hiring workers (since Rubio misstated the unknown amount Trump paid out), and we're rating Trump false on his denial of Rubio's claim. We're also going to rate Trump false on his literal claim that he's the \"only one at this stage that's hired people.\" While Trump may have the most extensive business experience of the Republican candidates, Ben Carson likely hired people as the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, Kasich likely hired people as a governor, and all of the candidates have hired numerous campaign staffers in the past year. Reality Check: Rubio on Obama's executive order By Lisa Rose, CNN During a discussion of immigration, Rubio said that President Barack Obama knowingly violated the Constitution with his executive order halting deportations of young people in 2012. \"The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional,\" Rubio said. \"The President doesn't have the power to do that. And he himself admitted that.\" During a 2014 speech, Obama said, \"I just took action to change the law\" in response to protesters who criticized him for not doing enough to help immigrants. But he also said that the administration was looking at how existing laws are being enforced. \"The way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally,\" Obama said. Conservatives criticized the executive order as overreach by the executive branch and the controversy continues to play out in the courts. The program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is awaiting a ruling by the Supreme Court. While Rubio claimed that Obama \"admitted\" he violated the Constitution with the executive order, the President didn't say he deliberately crossed the line bypassing congress. Rubio raised a valid point, questioning if the executive order violated the separation of powers principle, but he mischaracterized how the President has described the action he took. Verdict: False . Reality Check: Rubio on entitlements' impact on the federal budget By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney In talking about balancing the federal budget, Rubio once again talked about how just a few programs cost a lot of money. \"In less than five years, 83% of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the interest on the debt,\" Rubio said. \"That means only 17% of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.\" CNN's Reality Check team looked at that claim when he said it at a recent CNN Town Hall . We found that those three programs and interest payments actually are projected to make up 60% of the federal budget in 2021, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, citing Congressional Budget Office estimates. They currently make up 54% of the budget. It looks like Rubio was referring to the increase in government spending, not the actual budget. Social Security, major federal health programs and interest will account for 83% of the increase in government outlays between 2016 and 2026, the center said.

      "text": "Story highlights The Republican candidates for president gathered in Houston Thursday for their last debate before Super Tuesday A team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated Washington (CNN) The Republican candidates for president gathered in Houston on Thursday for their last debate before Super Tuesday, and CNN's Reality Check Team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated. Donald Trump Reality Check: Trump on American taxes By Kate Grise and Tami Luhby, CNN Read More Donald Trump reprised a claim he's made in past debates, saying the United States is the \"highest taxed country in the world.\" Responding to a question about his plan to cut taxes, Trump said, \"If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.\" As CNN's Reality Check team did when Trump made this claim two weeks ago, we'll look at each part of his claim that American individuals and businesses pay more taxes than any other country. So, do Americans really pay more individual taxes than citizens of any other country in the world? Hardly. America ranked 17 out of 34 Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development member countries for total tax revenue per capita in 2014. In America, the tax revenue per capita is $14,203.90. In Luxembourg, the country with the highest tax revenue per capita, that rate is almost $50,000. Norway's tax revenue per capita hits more than $38,000. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland round out the top five countries with the highest tax revenue per capita. OECD's 34 member countries are advanced, industrialized nations, which makes their data valuable in comparing the United States to similar countries. China, Russia and India are not included in the OECD's list because they are not member countries. We can also look at total tax revenue as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product. This time, America ranks even lower -- 27th out of 34 OECD member countries in 2014. America's tax revenue is 26% of the country's GDP. Denmark tops the list, with its tax revenue being equal to 50% of the country's GDP. Looking at whether American citizens face the highest taxes, we rate Trump's claim as false . Turning to companies, it's true that American businesses face the highest official corporate tax rate. The federal rate stands at 35%. But that's not what many companies actually pay. The Government Accountability Office found that large, profitable U.S. corporations paid an average effective federal tax rate of 12.6% in 2010 , thanks to things like tax credits, exemptions and offshore tax havens. U.S. corporate tax collection totaled 2.6% of GDP in 2011, according to the OECD. That was the 11th lowest in a ranking of 27 wealthy nations. So when it comes to American corporations, we rate Trump's statement as true, but misleading . The United States has the highest official corporate tax rate, but that's not what many companies actually pay. Reality Check: Trump has a dirty mouth By Sonam Vashi, CNN Asked about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's comments from earlier Thursday ( \"I'm not going to pay for that f**king wall!\" ), Trump said, \"I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been a national scandal. This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television and he should be ashamed of himself and he should apologize, OK?\" However, the businessman has a history that shows his own mouth might need to be washed out with soap. Cover your ears, children. In April 2011, he blasphemed at a large Las Vegas rally on oil prices (\"We have nobody in Washington that sits back and said, 'You're not going to raise that f***king price!'\"), on putting tariffs on China (\"Listen, you mother***kers, we're going to tax you 25%!\") and on military presence abroad (\"We build a school, we build a road, they blow up the school, we build another school, we build another road they blow them up, we build again, in the meantime we can't get a f***king school in Brooklyn.\"). Listen for yourself in the (bleeped) Vine below. That's not even counting the profanity he's uttered during this campaign season. Whether it's wanting to \"bomb the s**t out of\" ISIS , calling Cruz a \"pussy,\" or casually cursing during interviews , Trump's indignation over Fox's expletive seems a bit feigned when it comes to his own history. We rate Trump's outrage as %$*# . Reality Check: Trump on paying for the wall with Mexico By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Trump has long said he wants to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and get the Mexican government to pay for it. More recently, he's been tying the issue to America's trade deficit with its southern neighbor. \"We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country. We are going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion,\" Trump said. It's true that the trade deficit with Mexico was $58 billion last year. But that doesn't mean the Mexican government can pay for the wall ... not to mention whether they'd even agree to. The deficit means that private firms in Mexico have earned more money from trading with the U.S. than U.S. firms have earned from trade with Mexico, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"It not like it's a pot of money available to the Mexican government,\" he said. So it's false that the trade deficit gives Mexico the money to pay for the wall. CNN also looked at the cost of building the wall . Construction experts said a wall fashioned out of pre-casted concrete panels -- similar to those that run alongside highways -- would be the most workable choice. Based on the price of highway panels, the price tag for the wall alone would cost around $10 billion, which is not accounting for the cost of construction that would take at least four years over the border's diverse terrain. Other construction estimates have come in much higher. A retired estimator and economist for one of the nation's largest construction firms calculated it would cost nearly $25 billion, according to The Washington Post. We rate Trump's claim that building the wall would cost between $10 billion and $12 billion as false . Reality Check: Trump accidentally calls himself out By Amy Gallagher and Chad Weaver, CNN Trump said, \"I don't repeat myself. I don't repeat myself.\" But by our count, he repeated himself at least 20 times during the debate. Some examples: \"Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We'll be dynamic again.\" \"We will have a dynamic economy again.\" \"We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.\" \"We have the highest taxes in the world.\" \"I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands ...\" \"Let me talk. I've hired tens of thousands of people.\" \"And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You've hired nobody.\" We rate his claim false . False . Reality Check: Trump on \"Israeli Day Parade\" By Lisa Rose, CNN Trump touted his bona fides as a supporter of Israel during the debate, sparring with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz over which one of them is a more devoted booster of America's close ally. Trump said, \"I was the grand marshal, (walking) down Fifth Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade.\" And Trump added, \"I received their Tree of Life award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.\" The real estate tycoon indeed marched in a parade called Salute to Israel in 2004. The New York Daily News reported that Trump was heckled by pro-Palestine activists chanting, \"You're fired.\" Trump said he has close ties with the nation he has yet to visit as a candidate. He was scheduled to go there in December but canceled the trip after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized him for proposing a travel ban on Muslims in the wake of the San Bernardino attack. The Tree of Life prize is awarded by the Jewish National Fund, a charity that supports environmental initiatives and land development in Israel. A number of Jewish organizations have honored Trump over the years for his philanthropy, but the government of Israel has not yet given him a prize as he claimed Thursday. Verdict: True, but misleading . Reality Check: Cruz on Wall Street Journal article on Arizona immigration By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney In a heated debate about illegal immigration, Cruz noted that undocumented workers fled Arizona after the state cracked down on them. He cited a Wall Street Journal story that outlined the impact on state and business spending. \"What the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, on education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars, and the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants, who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop, are seeing wages rise,\" Cruz said. The number of undocumented workers in Arizona dropped by 40% between 2007 and 2012, the Journal writes, citing a Pew Research Center report. Here's what the Journal article actually said about the economic impact of that decline: -- The number of students enrolled in intensive English courses in Arizona public schools fell from 150,000 in 2008 to 70,000 in 2012 and has remained constant since. Schooling 80,000 fewer students would save the state roughly $350 million a year, by one measure. -- Annual emergency-room spending on non-citizens fell 37% from $167 million to $106 million. -- The annual cost to state prisons of incarcerating non-citizens convicted of felonies fell 11% from $202 million to $180 million. -- Wages rose about 15% for Arizona farmworkers and about 10% for construction between 2010 and 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's true that the Journal story said that spending on education dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. But Cruz exaggerates the other claims, so we rate them as false . The savings from fewer incarcerations are much smaller and the Journal doesn't mention welfare spending. In fact, it notes that undocumented immigrants cannot receive government benefits, including non-emergency hospital care. Also, while wages have gone up, the story doesn't specify whether pay is rising for legal immigrants. It noted that some of the low-skilled workers who benefited are native born. Reality Check: Cruz on everyone's illegal immigration records By Kate Grise, CNN Cruz kicked off the debate by defending his own record on illegal immigration and attacking others on stage. He made many claims about his record and those of two of the other candidates on stage with him. Let's look at them one by one. \"I really find it amazing that Donald believes he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you that when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall,\" Cruz said. During the race for his Senate race in 2012, Cruz said he opposed amnesty -- which to him means no pathway to citizenship or legal status for undocumented immigrants -- multiple times. \"Neither party is serious about stopping it. I strongly oppose illegal immigration. I categorically oppose amnesty. I support legal immigrants who come here supporting the American Dream,\" Cruz said in an interview with Hot Air in May 2012. In the same interview, Cruz said, \"We need to do everything humanly possible to secure the borders. Electronic surveillance, a wall, helicopters and, most importantly, boots on the ground.\" We rate Cruz's claim that he campaigned on a promise to fight amnesty and build a wall as true . Reality Check: Cruz says Trump is for 'socialized medicine' By Chip Grabow, CNN On the topic of health care, Cruz claimed Trump \"for decades ... has been advocating 'socialized medicine.' What he's said is that the government should pay for everyone's health care. And, in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.\" Cruz may be confusing \"universal health care\" with \"socialized medicine,\" two different things. The former means that everyone gets coverage. Socialized medicine means medicine and hospital services are paid for by taxes. And while we haven't found a record of Trump saying this during a debate, on ABC's \"This Week\" last month, he did allude to Cruz being heartless. Host George Stephanopoulos reminded Trump that Cruz was telling voters, \"A vote for Trump is a vote for Obamacare.\" Trump responded, \"I want people taken care of. I have a heart. I want people taken care of. If people have no money, we have to help people.\" Trump went on, saying of Cruz, \"Maybe he's got no heart.\" We did discover multiple instances as far back as 1999 where Trump has made clear his support of universal healthcare. Here's a few of them: Last September, in an interview on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Trump told Scott Pelley: \"I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.\" Pelley: \"The uninsured person is going to be taken care of. How? How?\" Trump: \"They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably --\" Pelley: \"Make a deal? Who pays for it?\" Trump: \"The government's gonna pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most, it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.\" Trump also spoke highly of universal health care in his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" where he wrote: \"We must have universal health care ... I'm a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one ... We need, as a nation, to re-examine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\" In 1999, Trump flirted with a presidential run as a Reform Party candidate. That year, he told CNN's Larry King: \"If you can't take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it's all over. ... I believe in universal health care.\" Trump may have an out for some of his claims -- he's often added that, while it's worked well in other countries like Scotland or Canada, he didn't think it would work as well in the U.S. While specific details are hard to come by regarding Trump's health care policies, he has made clear his support of universal health care, but not socialized medicine as Cruz claims. Verdict: False . Donald Trump and Ted Cruz Reality Check: Cruz and Trump on Libya intervention By Jamie Crawford, CNN In a discussion about the 2011 military intervention in Libya by the United States and its international allies, Cruz and Trump engaged in a vigorous debate about Trump's stance on the issue and the question of whether Libya was better off without Moammar Gadhafi in power. Trump said the following about Cruz: \"He's saying I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.\" In fact, Trump did speak out about the intervention in Libya in 2011 and the fate of Gadhafi. \"I can't believe what our country is doing,\" said Trump on a video blog of his in 2011. \"Gadhafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we're sitting around, we have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we're not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that's what it is: It's a carnage.\" Trump went further in the same remarks, saying that Gadhafi's ouster would be best for Libya. \"Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don't want to get involved and you're gonna end up with something like you've never seen before,\" Trump said at the time. Trump appeared to be calling for a military intervention in Libya and for Gadhafi's ouster in his 2011 remarks, which are at odds with his statement at the debate that the country would be better off with Gadhafi in power. We rate his statement Thursday night as false . In his remarks at the debate, Cruz said the following: \"He stated that in an interview that will be on our website, TedCruz.org, and you can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, that I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.\" Cruz's website does indeed link to the same 2011 video, so we rate his remarks as true . Donald Trump and John Kasich Reality Check: Trump and Kasich on fracking and jobs By Marshall Cohen and Sandee LaMotte, CNN Trump said of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, \"I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor -- but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Ohio a lot.\" Kasich replied, \"OK, let me just talk about that. Donald believes the energy industry is important and so do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.\" We checked a similar claim Trump made during a debate last October. Fracking first took off in Ohio four years ago. Since then, it has attracted more than $22 billion in investments to the state and the industry estimated that it would create 200,000 jobs. However, independent analysts concluded that job growth has not been nearly as robust as first predicted. IHS Global Insight, an economic analysis company, attributed the improving economy in Ohio to the fact that the manufacturing industry was expanding and that the population was growing slowly. They determined that the auto and plastics industries were the main drivers of growth -- not fracking. We rate Trump's claim as false . As for Kasich's response, we've fact-checked the 400,000 jobs figure before and found it to be true for private sector jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Marco Rubio Reality Check: Rubio says Obamacare is a certified job-killer By Tami Luhby and Kate Grise, CNN Florida Sen. Marco Rubio repeated his claim that Obamacare is \"a certified job-killer.\" \"It's bad for our economy,\" Rubio said. \"It's a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. It's not just a bad health care law, it's a job-killing law, and I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.\" In fact, Obamacare is not a job killer, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September. The report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. An ADP Research Institute study had similar findings. In fact, that study showed that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage. One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs. As to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers. Verdict: False . Reality Check: Rubio on Trump hiring undocumented workers By Sonam Vashi, CNN A fiery back-and-forth between Rubio and Trump elicited this lengthy exchange: Rubio: \"You're the only person on this stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.\" Trump: \"No, no, I'm the only one at this stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anybody.\" Rubio: \"In fact, some of the people --\" Trump: \"And by the way -- I've hired tens of thousands of people over my job. You've hired nobody. You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera.\" Rubio: \"Let me say --\" Trump: \"You haven't hired one person, you liar.\" Rubio: \"He hired workers from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars.\" Trump: \"That's wrong. Totally wrong.\" Rubio: \"People can look it up. I'm sure people are Googling right now. 'Trump Polish workers.' You'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it. That happened.\" And so on. We Googled \"Trump Polish workers\" and here's what we found. In 1980, a contracting company called Kaszycki & Sons Contractors hired a group of undocumented Polish immigrants to demolish a building that would later make room for the Trump Tower in Manhattan. Some of the workers were paid $4 an hour, working 12-hour shifts, and some of the workers never received the wages owed to them, according to litigation cited by The New York Times . In 1983, Trump was sued on the workers' behalf, involving allegations that he used undocumented Polish workers to avoid paying union medical and pension benefits. Trump denied ever knowing that the workers were undocumented, since the hiring was made by the contracting company. In 1991, a judge ruled that Trump conspired with the union president \"to withhold payments to the funds\" and owed more than $325,000. That ruling was appealed, and the prosecutor in the case estimated that the money owed could reach about $4 million, according to the Times . The case was eventually settled out of court in 1999, and the amount paid was unclear. We're not sure where Rubio got his $1 million figure from, but the final figure that Trump paid out was never made public. Additionally, The Washington Post reported last summer that a Trump company may have been employing some undocumented workers to construct a new hotel in downtown Washington, D.C. We're going to rate Rubio mostly true on his claim that Trump was fined for illegally hiring workers (since Rubio misstated the unknown amount Trump paid out), and we're rating Trump false on his denial of Rubio's claim. We're also going to rate Trump false on his literal claim that he's the \"only one at this stage that's hired people.\" While Trump may have the most extensive business experience of the Republican candidates, Ben Carson likely hired people as the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, Kasich likely hired people as a governor, and all of the candidates have hired numerous campaign staffers in the past year. Reality Check: Rubio on Obama's executive order By Lisa Rose, CNN During a discussion of immigration, Rubio said that President Barack Obama knowingly violated the Constitution with his executive order halting deportations of young people in 2012. \"The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional,\" Rubio said. \"The President doesn't have the power to do that. And he himself admitted that.\" During a 2014 speech, Obama said, \"I just took action to change the law\" in response to protesters who criticized him for not doing enough to help immigrants. But he also said that the administration was looking at how existing laws are being enforced. \"The way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally,\" Obama said. Conservatives criticized the executive order as overreach by the executive branch and the controversy continues to play out in the courts. The program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is awaiting a ruling by the Supreme Court. While Rubio claimed that Obama \"admitted\" he violated the Constitution with the executive order, the President didn't say he deliberately crossed the line bypassing congress. Rubio raised a valid point, questioning if the executive order violated the separation of powers principle, but he mischaracterized how the President has described the action he took. Verdict: False . Reality Check: Rubio on entitlements' impact on the federal budget By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney In talking about balancing the federal budget, Rubio once again talked about how just a few programs cost a lot of money. \"In less than five years, 83% of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the interest on the debt,\" Rubio said. \"That means only 17% of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.\" CNN's Reality Check team looked at that claim when he said it at a recent CNN Town Hall . We found that those three programs and interest payments actually are projected to make up 60% of the federal budget in 2021, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, citing Congressional Budget Office estimates. They currently make up 54% of the budget. It looks like Rubio was referring to the increase in government spending, not the actual budget. Social Security, major federal health programs and interest will account for 83% of the increase in government outlays between 2016 and 2026, the center said. Verdict: False . <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Sections",

      "text": "we tell stories for a better world. Like us on Facebook to get them first: Like Upworthy on Facebook: I've got some news that might be, er, tough to swallow for you shrimp lovers out there. \nSome of that succulent seafood you're used to seeing on a plate like this... Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images. \n...or — if you're more about that deep-fried life — all crispy like this... Photo by Rod Lamkey Jr./AFP/Getty Images. \n...it may have been plucked from the sea in a port that looks something like this: Photo by Paula Bronstein/ Getty Images. The photo above was taken in Thailand, a country where slave labor has become all too common within the fishing industry. \nFishing is a huge industry in Thailand — worth roughly $7 billion in exports every year — with people in markets like Europe and North America gobbling up whatever fishermen are catching. \nThe bad news? At least some of the profits these Thai companies rake in are being made on the backs of slaves, an Associated Press exposé revealed last year. \nSo, yep ... if you've snagged seafood from stores like Walmart or Kroger , you may have bought crustaceans caught by slaves. Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images. \nThrough empty promises of (paid) work, many slaves are lured into human trafficking circles across South Asi a , where they're abused, drugged , and caged , with no pay for their labor. Some Thai officials, by the way, had been well aware of (and even helped facilitate ) this atrocity. \n\"I cried,\" Lang Long, a former slave who'd been rescued, told The New York Times last year about being resold between fishing boats multiple times. \nBut thanks to the AP's original exposé and many follow-up reports, about 2,000 former slaves have been rescued by authorities , and several of their traffickers have been arrested. \nAnd now we can mark another tally in the \"win\" column for justice on the issue. President Barack Obama signed a bill on Feb. 24, 2016, that effectivelybanned all imports of seafood caught by slaves in Southeast Asia into the U.S. \nIf you're like me, your first reaction to this news might have been, \" Y ay!\" quickly followed by, \" B ut wait ... why wasn't this already the law of the land?\" \nTo get to the answer, you have to travel back more than a few decades. Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images. \nUntil Obama signed the bill into law, an 85-year-old tariff law in place had a major loophole that allowed products processed through slave labor to make it onto U.S. soil legally . The loophole allowed imports, regardless of how a given product was made or processed, if there was not enough supply to meet demand domestically. \nThe Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 kicks that loophole to the curb. \nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) led the charge to include the ban within the larger bill. \n\"It's embarrassing that for 85 years, the United States let products made with forced labor into this country,\" Brown said, according to the AP . \"Closing this loophole gives the U.S. an important tool to fight global slavery.\" This is big news because the import ban stops products other than seafood that have been created or processed by slave laborers, too. \nLike gold mined by kids in poor countries. Thousands of children, such as the boy pictured above in Africa's Burkina Faso, are subjected to hazardous gold mining operations throughout the developing world. Photo by Ahmed Ouoba/Getty Images. \nAnd garments sewn in Bangladesh by women who've been subjected to abuse. Remember the 400 people who'd been killed in 2013 while working in a Bangladesh factory? They were making products bought by many consumers in the West — while getting paid less than $50 a month. Photo by Munir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty Images. Yes, this ban only applies to U.S. imports, and certainly falls short of solving the global crisis of child and slave labor. But it's a big step. \nAnd now you can help push progress forward, too. The more people who know about modern slave labor — and use their purchasing power to fight it — the better equipped we are to end the injustice.

      "text": "Donald Trump teased a “big announcement” in Texas on Friday, and hours later out came New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announcing his endorsement of the Republican front-runner. Before the former presidential candidate dropped out earlier this month, he took quite a few swipes at the billionaire businessman he now says is “the best choice” to back.\nHere they are:\n1. Whiner-and-moaner-in-chief? — January 2016\nTrump refused to participate in a Fox News debate after the network mocked the billionaire with a press release. At the time, Christie’s observation to Trump was, “Things don’t always go your way.”\n“I got sent down to the undercard debate by Fox News,” he told Sean Hannity. “I didn’t think it was fair. But I didn't whine and moan and complain and walk away. I went to the debate. I argued my points.”\nChristie also complained about the media coverage of Trump, who frequently phones into interviews while other candidates appear either in-person.\n“He sits in his jammies in Trump Tower and phones in. You guys don't let any of the rest of us do that,\" Christie said.\n2. Acting like a teenager — January 2016\nChristie slammed Trump for acting like a “13-year-old” when he threatened to boycott a Fox News debate, questioning his temperament to be president.\n“What’s that tell you about what we can expect if things go sideways when you go into the Oval Office? What are you going to do? Go upstairs to the residence and say I’m not playing?” he said. “You know, Vladimir Putin isn’t being nice to me, I’m not going to return his call? The press isn’t being nice to me, I’m not going to hold any more press conferences?”\n3. We don’t need reality TV in the Oval Office — December 2015\nAhead of the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, Christie expressed a clear message to caucus-goers: The former “Celebrity Apprentice” host doesn’t belong in the White House.\n“We do not need reality TV in the Oval Office right now,” he said. “President of the United States is not a place for an entertainer.”\n4. No competition — December 2015\nTrump questioned how Christie could run “deeply troubled” New Jersey when he’s spending so much time campaigning in New Hampshire. “New Jerseyans not happy!” Trump claimed.\nBut Christie shot back, dismissing Trump as someone he’s not in competition with. “Listen, I think you’ve got a group of folks like Jeb Bush and John Kasich and Marco Rubio who are the people that I’m really competing with in New Hampshire,” Christie told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. “I don’t feel, at the moment, directly in competition with Donald Trump on these things. I feel much more in competition with Jeb Bush and John Kasich and, to some extent, also Marco Rubio.”\n5. Trump is inexperienced — December 2015\nAfter Trump’s infamous and controversial proposal to bar Muslims from entering the U.S., Christie cited that as an example of the businessman’s inexperience — something he said this country doesn’t need.\n“The fact is we don't need to be profiling in order to be able to get the job done here,” Christie told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “What you need is a president who's had the experience and the know-how to do this and not someone who's just going to talk off the top of their head.”\n6. Trump has to decide whether he’s serious — September 2015\nA supporter suggested during a Trump rally that Muslims were a problem and President Barack Obama was a Muslim — Trump engaged him but didn’t correct him. Christie would have.\n“Listen, Donald Trump’s got to decide, as we’ve seen — I’ve said this all along — he’s got to decide how serious a candidate he wants to be and how he handles different problems like this are going to determine that in the eyes of the American people,” he said on NBC’s “Today.”\n7. Trump’s a great guy but isn’t suited to be president — August 2015\nLast summer, Christie praised The Donald before but questioned whether he should be president. He’s “a great guy and a good person,” Christie said, “but I just don’t think that he’s suited to be president of the United States.”\nSpeaking on Fox News’ “On the Record with Greta Van Susteren,” Christie added that he didn’t believe Trump’s “temperament is suited for that and I don’t think his experience is.”",

      "text": "Story highlights New Jersey governor Chris Christie endorsed Donald Trump's presidential bid Friday The endorsement came the day after Trump endured a brutal debate where he fought with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz Christie's dropped his own presidential bid earlier this month (CNN) Marco Rubio now knows the fury of Donald Trump when he's scorned.\nThe Republican front-runner on Friday hit back at the Florida senator who rattled him in a CNN debate the night before by unveiling the bombshell endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on an extraordinary day when the already wild 2016 presidential campaign turned into a political bloodbath.\nChristie showed up unannounced in Fort Worth, Texas, to laud Trump and savage Rubio, drawing gasps from reporters, after concluding the billionaire was destined to win the Republican nomination and was the best person to slug it out with Hillary Clinton for the White House.\n\"I will lend my support between now and November in any way for Donald,\" Christie told shocked reporters before Trump fired up a rally in the state with most delegates up for grabs in the Super Tuesday primaries next week.\nIn the short term, Christie's move put a halt to Rubio's victory lap after his stunning prosecution of Trump's character, background and business career in Thursday night's GOP debate, the most effective takedown of the billionaire so far in this campaign.\nRead More In the longer term, Christie's support equips Trump with a powerful and outspoken surrogate who can match the former reality star's tart tongue and, like him, can inflame a media narrative critical of his opponents.\nTrump accompanied his rollout of Christie with a stream of invective against Rubio, reflecting the raised stakes ahead of Super Tuesday and the scorched-earth duel now raging between them.\nAs the campaign headed further toward the gutter, Trump branded Rubio a \"low life,\" \"a nasty little guy,\" a \"basket case\" and \"a choker\" who sweated so much he had to put makeup on with a trowel.\nThe Florida senator, meanwhile, punched back, seeming to relish his new aggressive campaign mode. He suggested Trump was a \"con artist\" who was worried about wetting his pants and mocked the serial tweeter's spelling before a delighted crowd in Texas.\nA source close to Christie said the governor's decision to jump back into the campaign alongside Trump just two weeks after bowing out after failing to feature in New Hampshire was the result of a number of factors.\nChristie has now concluded that Trump will indeed become the GOP's nominee after three consecutive wins, leaving him well positioned going into Super Tuesday. There is also little to suggest, in Christie's mind, that any other candidate can stop Trump.\nTherefore, the source said, Christie now believes it's time for the Republican Party to unite around its likely nominee for what figures to be a bitter battle with Clinton, the most likely Democratic nominee.\nFurthermore, the more moderate and pragmatic Christie has never been on the same ideological wavelength as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and the disdain he clearly feels for Rubio is genuine and deep, the source said.\nAlthough his own campaign faltered, and his belief that the next president should be a former governor with executive experience looks unlikely to be realized, Christie still believes that an executive -- like Trump -- would be the best fit for the White House.\nAnother source said that Christie had examined the state of the race and believed Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson had no viable path forward.\nYet, despite dropping out of the race, the source said the New Jersey governor wanted to be a factor in the campaign, and after his evisceration of Rubio in a debate in New Hampshire, he relishes the role of being Trump's top attack dog.\nIt may be no coincidence that a vice presidential nominee takes on that role. There will now be feverish speculation that Christie could end up alongside Trump on the GOP ticket.\nBut Christie would also be a possible fit for other jobs in any Trump cabinet, including attorney general or secretary of Homeland Security. Christie, as a more experienced political player than Trump, may also feel that he is now in a position to influence the direction and tone of the billionaire's often raucous campaign.\nThere is also a personal dimension to the endorsement. Christie and his wife Mary Pat have been friendly with the Trump family for more than a decade.\nBut the governor's move did cause some consternation in his inner circle, the source said, saying that some of his donors and campaign operatives were shocked. One such person said in a text message that he was \"stunned\" at his former boss's move.\nChristie's decision came at a time when establishment figures and donors are flocking to Rubio in the apparent belief that he is the only Republican who can stop Trump, who many leaders believe could be a disaster in a general election.\nIt is not the first time that Christie's maneuvering has caused uproar in a general election. His cozying up to President Barack Obama in the 2012 election after Hurricane Sandy infuriated GOP nominee Mitt Romney's campaign.\nKasich, Rubio teams respond\nA source close to Rubio's campaign dismissed Christie's endorsement.\n\"Who cares? (Christie) has zero support. Zero finance types,\" the source said.\nAnother Rubio source said, \"Christie is the invisible man to Republican primary voters.\"\nAnd senior Rubio aide Todd Harris poked fun at Trump for the endorsement.\n\"Gov. Christie is a very articulate guy which is probably why Donald Trump had to bring him on to his campaign,\" Harris said. \"Clearly Donald Trump is incapable of explaining any of his ideas for the future of this country, he's incapable of explaining what's hiding in his tax return.\"\nA staffer for Kasich explained the Christie endorsement this way: \"Marco hate.\"\nAnother Kasich staffer said Christie, who is friends with Kasich and received his early backing to lead the Republican Governors Association, didn't call the Ohio governor ahead of Friday's endorsement.\n\"It doesn't change anything for us,\" Kasich campaign spokesman Chris Schrimpf said. \"We are still the only adult in the race who is capable of running the country. Seems like a nightmare for Rubio, though.\"\nWhen asked about the endorsement, Cruz dodged on weighing in.\n\"This decision is going to be made by the voters on Super Tuesday,\" Cruz told Fox News' Sean Hannity in Nashville, Tennessee.\n'That part is over'\nWhile Christie profusely lauded Trump during the news conference Friday, the New Jersey governor known for his similarly brash style had previously slammed Trump as an \"entertainer in chief\" during the Republican primary race and called Trump's plan to temporarily ban Muslims from the United States \"ridiculous.\"\n\"That part is over,\" Christie said of the fighting between the two men during the primary race, adding that his decision to endorse Trump came down to \"who is the best person to stop Hillary Clinton from getting inside the White House ever again.\"\nHe added: \"There is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needs.\"\nTrump and Christie appeared on stage together the day after a tense debate in which the real estate mogul faced off against Rubio and Cruz. Christie and Trump took turns unloading on the freshman Florida senator, who spent the morning insulting the billionaire businessman.\nRELATED: Marco Rubio mocks Donald Trump for 'wet' pants\nJUST WATCHED Christie made the final mission of his campaign, which ended after the New Hamsphire primary, to disrupt Rubio Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nChristie made the final mission of his campaign, which ended after the New Hamsphire primary, to disrupt Rubio 01:41 \"Desperate people do desperate things,\" Christie said when asked about Rubio's comments, adding that his remarks were the \"flailing punches in the final days of the campaign.\"\nChristie, in the waning days of his own presidential campaign, had specifically targeted Rubio as not qualified for the office.\n\"Generally speaking, I'm not big on endorsements,\" Trump said, adding, \"This was an endorsement that really meant a lot.\"\nChristie said he decided Thursday to join Trump on the campaign trail.\n\"Yesterday morning I met with Donald and we sat and talked and he said, 'How about coming out to Texas with me?' and I said, 'Happy to do it, whenever you're ready sir,'\" Christie said.\nA Christie adviser said the two met Thursday at Trump Tower before the debate and Christie made up his mind to endorse either on the spot or soon after. Christie only told a small group of people Thursday night, but not until he was boarding a flight to Texas.\nAsked about whether he would consider Christie as his running mate should he win the nomination, Trump said he didn't \"want to discuss that,\" but added: \"He's certainly got the talent.\"\nTrump has previously said that he would pick a running mate with political experience, and not someone from the private sector like himself.",

The Republican front-runner on Friday hit back at the Florida senator who rattled him in a CNN debate the night before by unveiling the bombshell endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on an extraordinary day when the already wild 2016 presidential campaign turned into a political bloodbath. Christie showed up unannounced here to laud Trump and savage Rubio, drawing gasps from reporters, after concluding the billionaire was destined to win the Republican nomination and was the best person to slug it out with Hillary Clinton for the White House. \"I will lend my support between now and November in any way for Donald,\" Christie told shocked reporters before Trump fired up a rally in the state with most delegates up for grabs in the Super Tuesday primaries next week. \"Generally speaking, I'm not big on endorsements,\" Trump said, adding, \"This was an endorsement that really meant a lot.\" Read More In the short term, Christie's move put a halt to Rubio's victory lap after his stunning prosecution of Trump's character, background and business career in Thursday night's GOP debate, the most effective takedown of the billionaire so far in this campaign. In the longer term, Christie's support equips Trump with a powerful and outspoken surrogate who can match the former reality star's tart tongue and, like him, can inflame a media narrative critical of his opponents. Trump accompanied his rollout of Christie with a stream of invective against Rubio, reflecting the raised stakes ahead of Super Tuesday and the scorched-earth duel now raging between them. As the campaign headed further toward the gutter, Trump branded Rubio a \"low life,\" \"a nasty little guy,\" a \"basket case\" and \"a choker\" who sweated so much he had to put makeup on with a trowel. The Florida senator, meanwhile, punched back, seeming to relish his new aggressive campaign mode. He suggested Friday morning that Trump was a \"con artist\" who was worried about wetting his pants and mocked the serial tweeter's spelling before a delighted crowd in Texas. A source close to Christie said the governor's decision to jump back into the campaign alongside Trump just two weeks after bowing out after failing to feature in New Hampshire was the result of a number of factors. Christie has now concluded that Trump will indeed become the GOP's nominee after three consecutive wins, leaving him well positioned going into Super Tuesday. There is also little to suggest, in Christie's mind, that any other candidate can stop Trump. Therefore, the source said, Christie now believes it's time for the Republican Party to unite around its likely nominee for what figures to be a bitter battle with Clinton, the most likely Democratic nominee. Furthermore, the more moderate and pragmatic Christie has never been on the same ideological wavelength as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and the disdain he clearly feels for Rubio is genuine and deep, the source said. Although his own campaign faltered, and his belief that the next president should be a former governor with executive experience looks unlikely to be realized, Christie still believes that an executive -- like Trump -- would be the best fit for the White House. Another source said that Christie had examined the state of the race and believed Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson had no viable path forward. Yet, despite dropping out of the race, the source said the New Jersey governor wanted to be a factor in the campaign, and after his evisceration of Rubio in a debate in New Hampshire, he relishes the role of being Trump's top attack dog. It may be no coincidence that a vice presidential nominee takes on that role. There will now be feverish speculation that Christie could end up alongside Trump on the GOP ticket. But Christie would also be a possible fit for other jobs in a Trump cabinet, including attorney general or secretary of Homeland Security. Christie, as a more experienced political player than Trump, may also feel that he is now in a position to influence the direction and tone of the billionaire's often raucous campaign. There is also a personal dimension to the endorsement. Christie and his wife Mary Pat have been friendly with the Trump family for more than a decade. But the governor's move did cause some consternation in his inner circle, the source said, saying that some of his donors and campaign operatives were shocked. One such person said in a text message that he was \"stunned\" at his former boss's move. Christie's decision came at a time when establishment figures and donors are flocking to Rubio in the apparent belief that he is the only Republican who can stop Trump, who many leaders believe could be a disaster in a general election. It is not the first time that Christie's maneuvering has caused uproar in a general election. His cozying up to President Barack Obama in the 2012 election after Hurricane Sandy infuriated GOP nominee Mitt Romney's campaign. Kasich, Rubio teams respond A source close to Rubio's campaign dismissed Christie's endorsement. \"Who cares? (Christie) has zero support. Zero finance types,\" the source said. Another Rubio source said, \"Christie is the invisible man to Republican primary voters.\" And senior Rubio aide Todd Harris poked fun at Trump for the endorsement. \"Gov. Christie is a very articulate guy which is probably why Donald Trump had to bring him on to his campaign,\" Harris said. \"Clearly Donald Trump is incapable of explaining any of his ideas for the future of this country, he's incapable of explaining what's hiding in his tax return.\" A staffer for Kasich explained the Christie endorsement this way: \"Marco hate.\" Another Kasich staffer said Christie, who is friends with Kasich and received his early backing to lead the Republican Governors Association, didn't call the Ohio governor ahead of Friday's endorsement. \"It doesn't change anything for us,\" Kasich campaign spokesman Chris Schrimpf said. \"We are still the only adult in the race who is capable of running the country. Seems like a nightmare for Rubio, though.\" When asked about the endorsement, Cruz dodged on weighing in. \"This decision is going to be made by the voters on Super Tuesday,\" Cruz told Fox News' Sean Hannity in Nashville, Tennessee. 'That part is over' While Christie profusely lauded Trump during the news conference Friday, the New Jersey governor known for his similarly brash style had previously slammed Trump as an \"entertainer in chief\" during the Republican primary race and called Trump's plan to temporarily ban Muslims from the United States \"ridiculous.\" \"That part is over,\" Christie said of the fighting between the two men during the primary race, adding that his decision to endorse Trump came down to \"who is the best person to stop Hillary Clinton from getting inside the White House ever again.\" He added: \"There is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needs.\" Trump and Christie appeared on stage together the day after a tense debate in which the real estate mogul faced off against Rubio and Cruz. Christie and Trump took turns unloading on the freshman Florida senator, who spent the morning insulting the billionaire businessman. RELATED: Marco Rubio mocks Donald Trump for 'wet' pants JUST WATCHED Christie made the final mission of his campaign, which ended after the New Hamsphire primary, to disrupt Rubio More Videos ... MUST WATCH Christie made the final mission of his campaign, which ended after the New Hamsphire primary, to disrupt Rubio 01:41 \"Desperate people do desperate things,\" Christie said when asked about Rubio's comments, adding that his remarks were the \"flailing punches in the final days of the campaign.\" Christie, in the waning days of his own presidential campaign, had specifically targeted Rubio as not qualified for the office. And he kept up his attacks when he introduced Trump at a campaign rally in Oklahoma City later Friday. \"Marco Rubio, your campaign is almost over, buddy,\" Christie said. Christie said he decided Thursday to join Trump on the campaign trail. \"Yesterday morning I met with Donald and we sat and talked and he said, 'How about coming out to Texas with me?' and I said, 'Happy to do it, whenever you're ready sir,'\" Christie said. A Christie adviser said the two met Thursday at Trump Tower before the debate and Christie made up his mind to endorse either on the spot or soon after. Christie only told a small group of people Thursday night, but not until he was boarding a flight to Texas. Asked about whether he would consider Christie as his running mate should he win the nomination, Trump said he didn't \"want to discuss that,\" but added: \"He's certainly got the talent.\" Trump has previously said that he would pick a running mate with political experience, and not someone from the private sector like himself.
