The Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, won't stop talking about them. Sanders has proudly adopted the label of a \"democratic socialist,\" and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American future. In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \"freedom\" means... they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity. Sen. Bernie Sanders At a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October, Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what \"democratic socialism\" means to him. \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway,\" Sanders said, \"and learn what they have accomplished for their working people.\" Read More A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST \"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\" \"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PST While the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system. \"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\" But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports. \"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%. But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are onlylightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net. Houses stretch along a canal in Copenhagen The recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world. Over the past few years, studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street Journal, the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actuallymore economic freedom than the United States. \"There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true,\" said Bo Lidegaard, the executive editor-in-chief of Politiken , one of Denmark's leading newspapers. \"If by socialist you mean regulated, restrictive, the individual is not free to do what she or he wants, that is not what we have here. We have a society where the individual is perhaps freer than any other society because the government is securing the social contract so comprehensively.\" In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \"socialist\"--even a \"democratic socialist\"--as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades. \"When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it's a little bit 1970s,\" said Lars Christensen, a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homeland's model. \"The major political parties on the center-leftand the center-rightwould oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\" Could the U.S. adopt the Danish model?

        "text": "As Cuba Rises, Puerto Rico Falls 8 By James Gibney \nPresident Barack Obama dangles U.S. dollars before the Castros while Congress stonewalls Puerto Rico\u2019s pleas for debt restructuring. The Tampa Bay Rays take the field in Havana as San Juan fends off New York hedge funds wielding legal baseball bats. The Rolling Stones play a free concert for Cubans; Puerto Rico can\u2019t get no satisfaction. \nAs Cuba rises and Puerto Rico falls, it\u2019s worth considering the diverging trajectories of these two ex-Spanish colonies that the Puerto Rican poet Lola Rodr\u00edguez de Ti\u00f3 described more than 100 years ago as \u201ctwo wings of the same bird.\u201d Even as the resumption of diplomatic ties with the U.S. opens new possibilities for Cuba, Puerto Rico\u2019s current status as a U.S. commonwealth has turned into an ugly dead end. \nPuerto Rico is defaulting in slow motion on $70 billion worth of debt. Its economy has shrunk 9 of the past 10 years. A few hundred miles to the west, meanwhile, economic reforms are creating new livelihoods for self-employed Cubans, whose material conditions are improving. Buoyed by the arrival of new tourists, remittances, and foreign investments , Cuba\u2019s economy grew by 4 percent last year. \nAnd when the U.S. embargo is lifted, Cuba \u2013 which for much of the 19 th and 20 th centuries was the Caribbean\u2019s predominant economy -- is likely to take a growing bite out of Puerto Rico\u2019s fortunes, in tourism , manufacturing and services. And that's before accounting for Puerto Rico's existing fiscal straits, which will lead to shrinking government services, higher costs imposed by utilities under siege from creditors and a string of broken social promises and busted pensions. \nTrue, Cubans don\u2019t have democracy. Then again, at the national level, neither do Puerto Ricans: Despite being U.S. citizens, they can't vote for president or in Congress, which these days mostly ignores them. Cubans may face the threat of arbitrary detention and abuse. But they\u2019re much less likely than Puerto Ricans to be shot dead on the street, or to be victimized by drug traffickers or other criminals. \nIn fact, by many other yardsticks, you\u2019re better off being born in Cuba than Puerto Rico. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at the World Factbook put out by those raving socialists at the Central Intelligence Agency. Lower infant mortality? Check! Same with lower unemployment, higher literacy, and a lower overall death rate. \nThings weren\u2019t supposed to turn out this way for the island that President John F. Kennedy touted three months after the Bay of Pigs invasion as \u201ca source of hope and inspiration to those of us deeply concerned with charting new courses of social progress for our Hemisphere.\u201d \nPuerto Rico's Slide \nThe proximate cause of Puerto Rico\u2019s current distress is its crushing debt, which has tripled since 2000. And yes, irresponsible and corrupt legislators and executives (and the voters who elect them) deserve much of the blame. \nBut the larger problem has been Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with its federal overlords, who have oscillated between patronizing micromanagement and malign neglect -- devising ill-suited development strategies, granting and then revoking economic benefits, imposing regulations that undermined the island\u2019s competitiveness and creating disincentives for work. \nConsider the Washington-backed effort to turn Puerto Rico into a manufacturing hub. During the late 1940s, U.S. companies were given federal and local tax breaks to locate on the island. But U.S. minimum wage laws and trade agreements with other nations gradually eroded Puerto Rico's competitive advantages. Moreover, instead of investing in the island, U.S. companies brought their profits back to the mainland. \nIn 1976, the U.S. tried again, sweetening the pot for companies with Section 936 of the Federal Tax Reform Act. That created new jobs in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and electronics, but at huge fiscal cost as mainland corporations gamed tax laws. When the U.S. phased out the tax breaks, the island's manufacturing employment took a big hit -- a blow that Puerto Rico's legislators are quick to blame for the island's decline, not least because it conveniently absolves them for their own bad decisions. \nThe Republican-controlled U.S. Congress is now debating what to do about Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal mess. The island's top officials have all but begged for the ability to restructure the debt of its municipalities under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code \u2013 a power Puerto Rico had for decades until Congress took it away . Better yet would be the ability also to restructure its general obligation debt, which it can\u2019t realistically pay. \nCongress seems unlikely to allow restructuring. Instead, the Republican majority wants to impose a fiscal control board that takes over Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs. Analysts at Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for a New Economy have argued against this approach's \"colonial and imperialistic overtones,\" which also contradict the GOP's devolutionary, small-government philosophy. Instead, they advocate passing a \"fiscal responsibility law\" with strict enforcement provisions. \nAs smart as this idea looks on paper, the island\u2019s repeated failures to put its own fiscal house in order undermine that case. On the other hand, imposing a control board without granting debt relief risks accelerating Puerto Rico\u2019s downward spiral. \nThat brings us back to the central question of Puerto Rico\u2019s sovereignty. A control board for Puerto Rico would be all-too-consistent with its quasi-colonial status: Its legislators and executives behave irresponsibly in part because the buck doesn't stop with them. The island depends on the federal government for a quarter of its revenues, on terms that Washington sets, while it's straightjacketed by federal regulations that hurt its competitiveness and estrange it from neighboring economies. \nMaking Puerto Rico a state wouldn't necessarily cure it of bad fiscal behavior (see: Illinois). And independence would bring huge challenges. But remaining a commonwealth isn't working either. More than a half-century after JFK called Puerto Rico a \"source of hope and inspiration,\" its predicament should be a source of shame for every American. Its U.S. citizens have rates of poverty and unemployment that dwarf those on the mainland, and diminishing prospects that make a mock of the American Dream. They don't even enjoy the full benefits of the U.S. Constitution. \nTheir lot won't fundamentally improve until they seize control of their own destiny and choose between statehood or independence. And when they finally make that choice, Congress should honor it, either welcoming Puerto Rico as the 51 st state or allowing it to be independent. \nOnce Cuba gained its independence from U.S. control in 1902, it became theoretically free to make its own mistakes, notwithstanding the colossus to the north looking over its shoulder. And Lord knows Cuba made plenty of them, even before its current detour through socialist privation and repression. Over the years, Cuba has nonetheless delighted in tweaking Uncle Sam in the United Nations over Puerto Rico\u2019s \"colonial\" status, and is doubtless enjoying some quiet schadenfreude over its neighbor's troubles. \nYet these two islands can lift each other up. In addition to their shared history and culture, they face some similar demographic and economic challenges, and have some complementary strengths -- Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry and Cuba's nascent biotechnology sector, for instance. An unlikely partnership, perhaps. But as President Obama has noted about Cuban policy, we know what hasn't worked. Maybe it's time to try something different for Puerto Rico too.

        "text": "OUR MOBILE APPS iOS Android THE BLOG New Study: Sanders' Tax Wall Street Plan Would Raise $300 Billion, Create Millions of New Jobs 03/21/2016 02:31 pm ET Rose Ann DeMoro Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses Association \nNew research findings from a team of progressive economists provides documentary evidence that the financial footing for Sen. Bernie Sanders visionary social change agenda is not only plausible, but would create far more socially productive jobs, as well as moving us down the road to the more humane society that is at the heart of the Sanders campaign. \nIn their push to vilify Sanders, Democratic Party acolytes from the media to academia have fallen in line attacking the economic foundations of his campaign for free public college tuition, Medicare for all, job creation through infrastructure repair, and other critical needs. \nBut a new report from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute documents how a key Sanders proposal - a tax on Wall Street speculation -would bring at least $300 billion a year in new revenues from those who can most afford to pay it for the critical reforms the country so desperately needs. \nSen. Sanders with National Nurses United members at the introduction of his College for All Act funded by a tax on Wall Street speculation \nFurther, the report by Robert Pollin, lead author, and his colleagues James Heintz and Thomas Herndon, breaks new ground in documenting that the tax would be a huge boon to the economy in creating millions of new jobs in education beyond what the same spending creates on Wall Street. \nAnd contrary to the critics would not dampen productive investment, which has fallen sharply under the reckless Wall Street behavior of recent decades. \nTaxing Wall Street speculation to finance free public college tuition, as Sanders talks about on the campaign trail, and has introduced in legislation, S 1373, the College for All Act, could create a net expansion of 4.2 million jobs. Not to mention securing equal educational opportunity for everyone, regardless of background or ability to pay. \nInvesting in education produces more than 8 times the number of jobs created by the same spending in financial services, the authors explain. \nThis finding parallels a 2009 National Nurses United study that found conversion to a Medicare for all health care system, as Sanders also proposes, would create millions of new, good paying jobs, as would a green economy as Pollin documented in his 2012 book \"Back to Full Employment.\" \nSimply put, a socially productive economy, from education to healthcare to renewable energy is also a job creation engine. \nThe report's second ground breaking finding is that taxing Wall Street speculation would not harm productive investment in the economy, as the Wall Street shills constantly allege. \nSince the 1970s, with the escalation of a neoliberal program of decimation of our manufacturing sector with outsourcing, globalization, and the domination of the financial sector of the economy, there has been an 18-fold increase in Wall Street trading over productive investment in the economy, Pollin, Heintz and Herndon reveal. \nAs the authors note Wall Street speculation \"has not delivered\" in \"investments in physical plants and machinery that can deliver technical innovations (that) raise overall productivity.\" \nIn other words, the idea that the speculation tax would harm productive investments in a corporate dominated economy through outsourcing, unfair trade pacts from NAFTA to the Trans Pacific Partnership proposal, and domination by Wall Street, that has long abandoned manufacturing jobs at home and harmed millions of working class families is nonsense. \nFor those new to the idea of a speculation tax, or as nurses call it, the Robin Hood tax, is explained by Pollin, Heintz and Herndon. \nA simple tax of $5 in every $1,000 of stock trades, $1 on the trading of a $1,000 bond, and a mere 5 cents on the trades of derivatives, \"such as a stock option, in which the value of the underlying asset, i.e. the stock itself, is worth $1,000.\" \nCompare that to the average sales tax in the U.S. of 8.4 percent, or $84 on every $1,000 most Americans pay on nearly every consumer item, from shoes to tooth paste. \nFurther, the cost falls almost entirely on trading done by the biggest Wall Street high rollers - think Lehman Brothers or Goldman Sachs - the very people who tanked our economy by reckless gambling with people's mortgages and pensions. \nAnd, raise at least $300 billion a year, not from regular Americans who make occasional stock trades, but from the Wolves of Wall Street who make thousands or millions of trades a day, often through computerized algorithms. \nIndividuals with annual incomes under $50,000 and families under $75,000 a year are exempted through the two bills Sanders has introduced, S 1371, the Inclusive Prosperity Act, which parallels a companion House measure, HR 1464, introduced by Rep. Keith Ellison. \nNo surprise, Wall Street moguls, and their surrogates in the media and Washington, hate it. They don't want any restraints on their profiteering and stranglehold on the economy. But, shamefully, many in the liberal and Democratic Party elite, from Hillary Clinton to her surrogates in the Democratic National Committee and Congress have also attacked Sanders social change agenda as \"pie in the sky.\" \nEven though a similar tax is in place in most of the world's major financial markets, is in the process of implementation in the European Union, and actually existed in the U.S. for the first half of the last century. \nFar from the fear mongering here, a Wall Street tax is achievable, it would have an enormous salutary effect on our economy, and help lead the way to a program of such critical needs as education and health care for all, good paying jobs, and forceful action on the climate crisis - just as Bernie Sanders proposes.

        "text": "Story highlights Police conduct raids around Brussels for people linked to the attacks, state broadcaster reports Authorities in New York, Washington, Chicago and L.A. step up patrols after Brussels attacks Two explosions ripped through the Brussels Airport, and another happened at a subway station Brussels, Belgium (CNN) Three explosions that ripped through the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday killed at least 34 people and wounded about 170 more, according to Belgian media, and raised the reality of terror once again in the heart of Europe.\n\"We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters.\nBelgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport.\nAfter the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks.\nCiting judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks.\nRead More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.\nBrussels under attack: Live updates\n20 photos: Terror attacks in Brussels An injured woman leaves the Brussels airport after at least two explosions rocked the facility Tuesday, March 22.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based.\nRichard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for.\n\"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\"\nYet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\"\nThat doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening.\n\"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\"\nEurope, U.S. on alert as well\nBelgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport.\nThis comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs.\nIn addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside.\nThe ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well.\nAs far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon.\nSimilar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe.\nEurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels.\nUPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station.\n\u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium.\n\"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\"\nBritish police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard.\n1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport.\n\u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\n\"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\"\n\"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\"\nAirport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down\nThe darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building.\n\"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN.\nBarrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded.\nIn the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\"\nCNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added.\n\"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\"\nTraveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint.\nHe says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways.\nSoccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity'\nAbout an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station.\nPeople wounded outside #maelbeek #metro #brussels @cnnireport #brusselsattacks #maalbeek pic.twitter.com/JaqUEOz7Tl\n\u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks.\n\"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\"\nJUST WATCHED Subway witness: We fled through smoke Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nSubway witness: We fled through smoke 01:36 The Belgian crisis center tweeted that all public transportation in the city has been closed.\n\"Stay where you are,\" it said.\nKristalina Georgieva, the vice president of the European Commission, said that all the organization's institutions are at \"alert level orange\" and that all meetings on its premises and outside have been canceled.\nShe advised people to stay at home or indoors.\n\"I am shocked and concerned by the events in Brussels,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted. \"We will do everything we can to help.\"\nI am shocked and concerned by the events in Brussels. We will do everything we can to help.\n\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) March 22, 2016 Abdeslam, who authorities say was involved in the Paris terror attacks last year, was arrested in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek on Friday.\nBelgium's Prime Minister deflected a question about whether there's any link between Tuesday's bloodshed and Abdeslam's capture, saying it is too early to tell.\nHe said Tuesday that he had \"no information\" about who was responsible for the attack, adding that authorities will find that out, but right now their focus is on caring for the victims.\nBelgian national soccer team captain Vincent Kompany tweeted that he was \"horrified and revolted (that) innocent people (are) paying the price again,\" but he urged people not to encourage those wishing to lash out.\n\"We must reject hate and its preachers,\" Kompany said. \"... I wish for Brussels to act with dignity.\"\nFollow Joshua Berlinger on Twitter",

Belgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport. After the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks. Citing judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks. Read More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based. Richard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for. \"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\" Yet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\" That doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening. \"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\" Europe, U.S. on alert as well Belgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport. This comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs. In addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside. The ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well. As far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon. Similar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe. Eurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels. UPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station. \u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium. \"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\" British police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard. 1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport. \u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve. \"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\" That sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\" \"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\" Airport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down The darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building. \"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN. Barrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded. In the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\" CNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added. \"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\" Traveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint. He says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways. Soccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity' About an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station. \u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks. \"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\" JUST WATCHED",

        "text": "SHARE Martin Barraud\u2014Getty Images A million isn't what it used to be. But it's not bad, and here's how you get there. \nA million bucks isn\u2019t what it used to be. When your father, or maybe you, set that savings goal in 1980 it was like shooting for $3 million today. Still, millionaire status is nothing to sniff at\u2014and new research suggests that a broad swath of millennials and Gen-Xers are on the right track. \nThe \u201cemerging affluent\u201d class, as defined in the latest Fidelity Millionaire Outlook study, has many of the same habits and traits as today\u2019s millionaires and multimillionaires. You are in this class if you are 21 to 49 years of age with at least $100,000 of annual household income and $50,000 to $250,000 in investable assets. Fidelity found this group has five key points in common with today\u2019s millionaires: Lucrative career: The emerging affluent are largely pursuing careers in information technology, finance and accounting\u2014much like many of today\u2019s millionaires did years ago. They may be at a low level now, but they have time to climb the corporate ladder. High income: The median household income of this emerging class is $125,000, more than double the median U.S. household income. That suggests they have more room to save now and are on track to earn and save even more. Self-starters: Eight in 10 among the emerging affluent have built assets on their own, or added to those they inherited, which is also true of millionaires and multimillionaires. Long-term focus: Three in four among the emerging affluent have a long-term approach to investments. Like the more established wealthy, this group stays with its investment regimen through all markets rather than try to time the market for short-term gains. Appropriate aggressiveness: Similar to multimillionaires, the emerging affluent display a willingness to invest in riskier, high-growth assets for superior long-term returns. \nBecoming a millionaire shouldn\u2019t be difficult for millennials. All it takes is discipline and an early start. If you begin with $10,000 at age 25 and save $5,500 a year in an IRA that grows 6% a year, you will have $1 million at age 65. If you save in a 401(k) plan that matches half your contributions, you\u2019ll amass nearly $1.5 million. That\u2019s with no inheritance or other savings. Such sums may sound big to a young adult making little money. But if they save just $3,000 a year for seven years and then boost it to $7,500 a year, they will reach $1 million by age 65. \nAn emerging affluent who already has up to $250,000 and a big income can do this without breaking a sweat. They should be shooting far higher\u2014to at least $3 million by 2050, just to keep pace with what $1 million buys today (assuming 3% annual inflation). But they will need $6 million in 2050 to have the purchasing power of $1 million back in 1980, when your father could rightly claim that a million dollars would make him rich. ",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

        "text": "OUR MOBILE APPS iOS Android THE BLOG New Study: Sanders' Tax Wall Street Plan Would Raise $300 Billion, Create Millions of New Jobs 03/21/2016 02:31 pm ET Rose Ann DeMoro Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses Association \nNew research findings from a team of progressive economists provides documentary evidence that the financial footing for Sen. Bernie Sanders visionary social change agenda is not only plausible, but would create far more socially productive jobs, as well as moving us down the road to the more humane society that is at the heart of the Sanders campaign. \nIn their push to vilify Sanders, Democratic Party acolytes from the media to academia have fallen in line attacking the economic foundations of his campaign for free public college tuition, Medicare for all, job creation through infrastructure repair, and other critical needs. \nBut a new report from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute documents how a key Sanders proposal - a tax on Wall Street speculation -would bring at least $300 billion a year in new revenues from those who can most afford to pay it for the critical reforms the country so desperately needs. \nSen. Sanders with National Nurses United members at the introduction of his College for All Act funded by a tax on Wall Street speculation \nFurther, the report by Robert Pollin, lead author, and his colleagues James Heintz and Thomas Herndon, breaks new ground in documenting that the tax would be a huge boon to the economy in creating millions of new jobs in education beyond what the same spending creates on Wall Street. \nAnd contrary to the critics would not dampen productive investment, which has fallen sharply under the reckless Wall Street behavior of recent decades. \nTaxing Wall Street speculation to finance free public college tuition, as Sanders talks about on the campaign trail, and has introduced in legislation, S 1373, the College for All Act, could create a net expansion of 4.2 million jobs. Not to mention securing equal educational opportunity for everyone, regardless of background or ability to pay. \nInvesting in education produces more than 8 times the number of jobs created by the same spending in financial services, the authors explain. \nThis finding parallels a 2009 National Nurses United study that found conversion to a Medicare for all health care system, as Sanders also proposes, would create millions of new, good paying jobs, as would a green economy as Pollin documented in his 2012 book \"Back to Full Employment.\" \nSimply put, a socially productive economy, from education to healthcare to renewable energy is also a job creation engine. \nThe report's second ground breaking finding is that taxing Wall Street speculation would not harm productive investment in the economy, as the Wall Street shills constantly allege. \nSince the 1970s, with the escalation of a neoliberal program of decimation of our manufacturing sector with outsourcing, globalization, and the domination of the financial sector of the economy, there has been an 18-fold increase in Wall Street trading over productive investment in the economy, Pollin, Heintz and Herndon reveal. \nAs the authors note Wall Street speculation \"has not delivered\" in \"investments in physical plants and machinery that can deliver technical innovations (that) raise overall productivity.\" \nIn other words, the idea that the speculation tax would harm productive investments in a corporate dominated economy through outsourcing, unfair trade pacts from NAFTA to the Trans Pacific Partnership proposal, and domination by Wall Street, that has long abandoned manufacturing jobs at home and harmed millions of working class families is nonsense. \nFor those new to the idea of a speculation tax, or as nurses call it, the Robin Hood tax, is explained by Pollin, Heintz and Herndon. \nA simple tax of $5 in every $1,000 of stock trades, $1 on the trading of a $1,000 bond, and a mere 5 cents on the trades of derivatives, \"such as a stock option, in which the value of the underlying asset, i.e. the stock itself, is worth $1,000.\" \nCompare that to the average sales tax in the U.S. of 8.4 percent, or $84 on every $1,000 most Americans pay on nearly every consumer item, from shoes to tooth paste. \nFurther, the cost falls almost entirely on trading done by the biggest Wall Street high rollers - think Lehman Brothers or Goldman Sachs - the very people who tanked our economy by reckless gambling with people's mortgages and pensions. \nAnd, raise at least $300 billion a year, not from regular Americans who make occasional stock trades, but from the Wolves of Wall Street who make thousands or millions of trades a day, often through computerized algorithms. \nIndividuals with annual incomes under $50,000 and families under $75,000 a year are exempted through the two bills Sanders has introduced, S 1371, the Inclusive Prosperity Act, which parallels a companion House measure, HR 1464, introduced by Rep. Keith Ellison. \nNo surprise, Wall Street moguls, and their surrogates in the media and Washington, hate it. They don't want any restraints on their profiteering and stranglehold on the economy. But, shamefully, many in the liberal and Democratic Party elite, from Hillary Clinton to her surrogates in the Democratic National Committee and Congress have also attacked Sanders social change agenda as \"pie in the sky.\" \nEven though a similar tax is in place in most of the world's major financial markets, is in the process of implementation in the European Union, and actually existed in the U.S. for the first half of the last century. \nFar from the fear mongering here, a Wall Street tax is achievable, it would have an enormous salutary effect on our economy, and help lead the way to a program of such critical needs as education and health care for all, good paying jobs, and forceful action on the climate crisis - just as Bernie Sanders proposes.

His nonprofit, the Street Medicine Institute , supports communities in starting programs of their own. Its network includes dozens of teams in the United States and around the world. I recently talked with Withers about his work and his ultimate vision. Below is an edited version of our conversation: CNN: How does it work, doing rounds in homeless camps? Dr. Jim Withers: It can be a challenge to keep up with where the camps are. The homeless are often evicted. Their belongings are taken. And so they have to keep moving. And therefore we have to keep moving to keep up to date on their camps. Withers and a student treat Lois Burkes, who his organization helped find housing. Doing walking rounds, we try to keep our team down to four people. We don't want to invade (their space) with a lot of people. It's their home. So there's an outreach expert who knows the field and knows the people. There's myself or a medical person, and then we always have a student or two. And we bring a social worker with us. We'll go into the camp, and we make sure they're OK with us coming in. Almost all the homeless are cordial, if not downright really friendly. And we just join them, and they can express what's going on. We always try then to check in with how they're doing medically. If they have insurance, if they have medicines that they should be on that they ran out of. Do they have a doctor? \"Did you get that looked at?\" What's important to the patient, the person, is our priority. The care that we deliver out there is dependent on what's in our backpacks. We try to emphasize that this is not good enough. Getting (them) into primary care is our goal. Dr. Withers in his own words CNN: What ailments do you see out there? Withers: People on the street, they're exposed to the elements obviously. So you see a lot of things that have to do with the weather and the difficulties of sleeping out there: frostbite, dehydration, hypothermia. But they also have everyday things, like high blood pressure, diabetes, coughs and colds, pneumonia, injuries. 25 photos: 2015 CNN Heroes Giving needy a lift \u2013 All of the 2015 CNN Heroes show how one person can truly make a difference.

It was like going to a third-world country. Dr. Jim Withers We've seen people with cancers. We've seen liver failure, people who needed dialysis that we actually took to dialysis from the street. It goes on and on and on. We've seen almost everything that I've seen clinically and a few things that I hadn't. So it's a very rich environment for medical teaching, unfortunately. CNN: You consider the streets to be a kind of classroom for students. What is their experience? Withers: I see it in the eyes of the students that I take out. They see how many people are living in places that you'd never want to live. The weather, the rain, the cold. I think they also get the chance to see success. When they can see a street person succeed and not just get locked in that hopeless category, their vision changes. The street classroom really ignites, or reignites, what their passion is. They feel like, \"Yes, this is what it's about.\" And they carry that forward. I think the lessons the homeless can teach us about finding the humanity and listening to people are transcendent in all of health care. A plaque under a Pittsburgh highway commemorates the homeless men and women who have died. Our students, I like to think of them as viruses. And we're spreading them out and they're beginning to go to their medical residencies, and they're saying, \"Do you have street medicine here?\" or \"Why aren't you going under bridges?\" And so the dialogue is really spreading. CNN: What's your hope for the future? Withers: In the way I'd like to see things, every person who is still on the streets will have medical care that comes directly to them and says, \"You matter.\" And I'd love to see every medical school have a classroom of the streets. I've dedicated myself as much as I can to finding anyone, anywhere, who's interested in doing medical care to their own street people and helping them. Besides just the good that it does and the money that it saves, having street medicine in every community transforms us. We begin to see that we're all in this together. It's something that we should take pride in when we can actually treat people the way we would want to be treated. Want to get involved?

Sam Brownback (R) cut taxes for the wealthy and eliminated income taxes for small businesses, saying it would be a \"real live experiment\" for conservative economic policies. \"That's a terrible sales pitch for something,\" Meyers quipped. \"Those words only usually show up in shady classified ads.\" Supporters said the cuts would somehow generate $323 million in new revenue, but they actually produced a $688 million loss, and the state got creative when it tried to close the gap, at one point taking adult items seized from a business that owed back taxes and auctioning them off online. \nNow, residents are complaining about budgets being slashed and business owners are rejecting the drastic tax cuts, leading Meyers to believe the results of the experiment are in. \"Republicans want to replicate these policies on a national level, but even when you buy couch cleaner they tell you to try it on a small patch of fabric first,\" he said. \"That's what happened here \u2014 Kansas was the small patch of fabric. Not only did the cleaner not work, the couch exploded.\" Watch the (in some parts racy) video below. Catherine Garcia \nSamantha Bee takes a moderate whack at GOP Supreme Court obstruction, and a poke at Joe Biden 2:14 a.m. ET \nEver since Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly, Senate Republicans \"have made it clear that they're going to hold the Supreme Court hostage like a Mexican housekeeper locking Richard Simmons up in the crawl space,\" Samantha Bee said on Monday's Full Frontal . President Obama \"fulfilled his constitutional duty to troll the Republicans soooo hard\" by naming a moderate nominee, Merrick Garland, that many of them had just lauded, Bee said, showing a clip of Fox News pundits freaking out over Obama's \"trap.\" But Senate Republicans were ready with some trolling of their own. \nTheir first gambit was repeating \"the Biden Rule\" ad nauseam to justify their court-blocking. \"Ah, yes, the Biden Rule that totally exists,\" Bee said. \"What is the Biden Rule again?\" After showing a brief clip of Biden saying something stupid, she rolled the video of him talking about judicial appointments \u2014 but she played all the relevant parts . \"Oh, so Color Me Bad\u2013era Biden said he'd support a moderate nominee from President Bush,\" Bee said. \"That's so great! If that's the rule, let's get on with moderate Merrick's hearing \u2014 tick tock, you don't stop.\" \nBut Republicans had a backup catch-phrase: Lame-duck Obama. \"He's not a lame duck \u2014 he's three trimesters away from from lame-duckery,\" Bee protested. \"A president's term is four years. You can't say only three of those are legitimate and the fourth is garbage \u2014 they're not Indiana Jones movies.\" Finally, she found one Republican senator, Jeff Flake (Ariz.), willing to consider confirming Garland, at least if Hillary Clinton wins. Bee took her poke at the vice president, and Flake: \"Oh, dude! Did you just embarrass your party by blurting out the thing you're not supposed to say in public? Finally, someone following the actual Biden Rule!\" Watch below. Peter Weber Sign Up for 10 things you need to know today Today's best articles Today's top cartoons Daily business briefing Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nTed Cruz's campaign would love to get Marco Rubio on a unity ticket, but his former rival doesn't share the enthusiasm, multiple sources told Politico . \nWanting to block Donald Trump from the nomination, Cruz is looking at all of his options, the sources say, and one senator willing to work as a middleman between the Cruz and Rubio camps is Mike Lee (R-Utah). He tried to get a meeting with Rubio before the Florida primary, which Rubio lost to Trump, but was rebuffed, Politico reports. Undeterred, Cruz's team spent the last week conducting polls in upcoming primary states to see how he would do running with Rubio, the sources said. If nothing else, Cruz's campaign would like a Rubio endorsement, and those close to Rubio say he's open to it, particularly if he thinks Cruz has a shot at beating Trump. \nOn Fox News Monday night, Cruz said he hasn't talked about a unity ticket with Rubio, but isn't ruling it out. \"I think any Republican would naturally have Marco on their short list and you would look seriously to him as a vice presidential choice,\" he said.

Ted Cruz\u2019s tax plan, which is to virtually eliminate the IRS and tax code , to be replaced by a simple flat tax, would also see increases in take-home pay for all tax-paying brackets, with the average $55,000 worker bringing home an extra $55 per biweekly check. Advertisement - story continues below \nCruz\u2019s plan is also alleged to add to the federal deficit, to the tune of $8.6 trillion over 10 years, but again, that number could be discounted and changed by the implementation of other economy-motivating policies. \nSelf-declared socialist and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has unabashedly called for higher taxes on everyone, even the working class poor, in his efforts to redistribute all of the wealth and end income inequality by making everyone equally poor. The prototypical $55,000 worker would see a nearly $150 decrease in their paycheck. \nDespite the dramatically increased tax rates and ostensibly increased tax revenues, Sanders\u2019 plan would still add to the federal deficit as well, due to the fact that he would likely make few, if any cuts to the budget, and would instead add more government programs and spending, such as for truly universal single-payer health care and free college for everyone, among other handouts.

        "text": "This is your brain on heroin 01:51 Story highlights Today's typical heroin addict starts using at 23 and is likely to live in affluent suburbs Many users are turning to heroin after becoming addicted to painkillers Heroin and opioid pills are similar in many ways (CNN) The face of heroin abuse in America is changing. Back in the 1960s, heroin users were usually young men, who started using around an average age of 16. They were most likely from low-income neighborhoods, and when they turned to opiates, heroin was their first choice. Now, more than 50 years later, a study from JAMA paints a very different picture. Today's typical heroin addict starts using at 23, is more likely to live in the affluent suburbs and was likely unwittinglyled to heroin through painkillers prescribed by his or her doctor. While heroin is illicit and opioid pills such as oxycontin are FDA-approved, each is derived from the poppy plant. Their chemical structures are highly similar and they bind to the same group of receptors in the brain. (A few opioids, like fentanyl, are totally synthetic but designed to bind with those same receptors). Read More In any case, the various drugs produce the same result: an increase in pain tolerance and a sense of euphoria, along with drowsiness, occasional nausea and, at higher doses, a slowing of the user's breathing. All these drugs trigger \"tolerance\" -- the need to take higher doses for the same effect -- and a craving for the drug in its absence. It is precisely because there are so many similarities that pain pill addictsfrequently turn to heroin when pills are no longer available to them. Heroin is usually cheaper than prescription drugs. Opiate pain medications cost the uninsured about $1 per milligram; so a 60-milligram pill will cost $60. You can obtain the equivalent amount of heroin for about one-tenth the price . This may be news to you, but it's likely not to some of your neighbors, friends and family members. Last year, the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte spent time trying to better understand the patients who were coming into detox for heroin. What they found were cops, lawyers, nurses and ministers who came from some of the best neighborhoods in the area. Most of them shared a common story: \"We used to take pills, but now we inject heroin.\" For years, we have been railing about the flagrant abuse of pain pills in the United States. Former President Bill Clinton called me a couple years ago after he lost two friends to accidental prescription drug overdose. As we dug into the issue together, we were stunned to learn 80% of the world's pain pills are consumed in the United States, which has just 5% of the world's population. As a result, accidental prescription drug overdose is now the leading cause of acute preventable death for Americans. Someone dies in this manner every 19 minutes. That is more deaths than from car accidents. The response to these tragic statistics has been gratifying and effective, but somewhat shortsighted. Doctors have been less willing to prescribe medications, especially in states like Florida, formerly known for its pill mills, where tighter restrictions on prescribers led to a 23% drop in overdose deaths between 2010 and 2012. The drugs themselves have been tweaked as well. In August 2010, an abuse deterrent version of Oxycontin was released to great fanfare. It was reformulated so it could not as easily be crushed or solubilized so abusers would have a difficult time injecting or snorting it. Within two years, the choice of oxycontin as a drug of abuse went from 35.6% to 12.8% . That was the good news. The bad news is that the same study showed heroin use nearly doubled. It became apparent that drug abusers weren't going to stop as a result of government crackdowns or new technologies. They were simply morphing into people who abused other drugs. Oxycontin used to be called the hillbilly heroin. Society and technology helped fix that problem. But addicts started turning back to real heroin instead. A spokeswoman with the National Institute on Drug Abuse told us recently that nearly half of young people who inject heroin say they abused prescription opioids before turning to the illegal drug. The headlines are horrifying and for good reason. The abuse of opiate pills and heroin are both taking a tremendous toll on the United States. They are leading to increased crime, decreased productivity and they're stealing the lives of too many people . While it is nearly impossible to pit one evil against another, it is important to remember that heroin, as a street drug, is unregulated, often impure and usually injected. As a result, heroin users suffer from collapsed veins, abscesses, infections of the heart lining and valves, and rheumatological diseases. From sharing needles, they are more likely to suffer from HIV, Hepatitis and other blood diseases. And just like their pill popping counterparts, they die of overdose in shocking numbers. Some countries are more willing than the United States to pursue a strategy of harm reduction -- that is, to steer addicts away from the most dangerous types of behavior. A number of countries have implemented programs that actually provide heroin to addicts; some studies (PDF) show that doing so improves addicts' health and reduces their use of other illicit drugs. Marijuana laws may reduce painkiller deaths Yet in general, the U.S. strategy has not been harm reduction, but to target users and doctors. While all of this was unexpected, it was likely also predictable. Medication or drugs aren't the problem; it's the intrinsic behavior of human beings. We don't need to treat the drugs we are taking; we need to treat the drug addiction we are suffering. Like the people who take the pills in the first place, society wanted a quick fix. Instead of treating the core cause of drug addiction, we implemented blanket policies to restrict the medications, alter them and place them increasingly out of reach. Yet human beings are smart, and it was easy to reach for something on a lower shelf, more easily accessible. Make no mistake, the crackdown on opiates was a good thing, but there have been unintended consequences. On one side, patients with legitimate pain have been caught in the crossfire, easily dismissed as malingerers and unable to get relief. On the other side, abusers have become more creative, turning to heroin to feed their addiction. We must work to make sure treatment for drug addiction is a pillar of drug policy in the United States. We already know that it can work at levels similar to the effects of treatment of other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma. Good doctors don't focus on the symptoms of a disease; they want to ultimately treat the disease itself. If we do the same here, we can rid America of this awful drug habit, and save many lives in the process. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div>",
