                We want a transparent government where elected
                officials use facts and stats to create policy.
                Where our government uses technology to solve problems and where
                officials care more about solutions than their re-election. Getting
               there starts with advocacy. If you share our vision or have policy
               that fits the bill we'll do everything we can to help you enact change.
