      "text": "As Cuba Rises, Puerto Rico Falls 8 By James Gibney \nPresident Barack Obama dangles U.S. dollars before the Castros while Congress stonewalls Puerto Rico\u2019s pleas for debt restructuring. The Tampa Bay Rays take the field in Havana as San Juan fends off New York hedge funds wielding legal baseball bats. The Rolling Stones play a free concert for Cubans; Puerto Rico can\u2019t get no satisfaction. \nAs Cuba rises and Puerto Rico falls, it\u2019s worth considering the diverging trajectories of these two ex-Spanish colonies that the Puerto Rican poet Lola Rodr\u00edguez de Ti\u00f3 described more than 100 years ago as \u201ctwo wings of the same bird.\u201d Even as the resumption of diplomatic ties with the U.S. opens new possibilities for Cuba, Puerto Rico\u2019s current status as a U.S. commonwealth has turned into an ugly dead end. \nPuerto Rico is defaulting in slow motion on $70 billion worth of debt. Its economy has shrunk 9 of the past 10 years. A few hundred miles to the west, meanwhile, economic reforms are creating new livelihoods for self-employed Cubans, whose material conditions are improving. Buoyed by the arrival of new tourists, remittances, and foreign investments , Cuba\u2019s economy grew by 4 percent last year. \nAnd when the U.S. embargo is lifted, Cuba \u2013 which for much of the 19 th and 20 th centuries was the Caribbean\u2019s predominant economy -- is likely to take a growing bite out of Puerto Rico\u2019s fortunes, in tourism , manufacturing and services. And that's before accounting for Puerto Rico's existing fiscal straits, which will lead to shrinking government services, higher costs imposed by utilities under siege from creditors and a string of broken social promises and busted pensions. \nTrue, Cubans don\u2019t have democracy. Then again, at the national level, neither do Puerto Ricans: Despite being U.S. citizens, they can't vote for president or in Congress, which these days mostly ignores them. Cubans may face the threat of arbitrary detention and abuse. But they\u2019re much less likely than Puerto Ricans to be shot dead on the street, or to be victimized by drug traffickers or other criminals. \nIn fact, by many other yardsticks, you\u2019re better off being born in Cuba than Puerto Rico. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at the World Factbook put out by those raving socialists at the Central Intelligence Agency. Lower infant mortality? Check! Same with lower unemployment, higher literacy, and a lower overall death rate. \nThings weren\u2019t supposed to turn out this way for the island that President John F. Kennedy touted three months after the Bay of Pigs invasion as \u201ca source of hope and inspiration to those of us deeply concerned with charting new courses of social progress for our Hemisphere.\u201d \nPuerto Rico's Slide \nThe proximate cause of Puerto Rico\u2019s current distress is its crushing debt, which has tripled since 2000. And yes, irresponsible and corrupt legislators and executives (and the voters who elect them) deserve much of the blame. \nBut the larger problem has been Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with its federal overlords, who have oscillated between patronizing micromanagement and malign neglect -- devising ill-suited development strategies, granting and then revoking economic benefits, imposing regulations that undermined the island\u2019s competitiveness and creating disincentives for work. \nConsider the Washington-backed effort to turn Puerto Rico into a manufacturing hub. During the late 1940s, U.S. companies were given federal and local tax breaks to locate on the island. But U.S. minimum wage laws and trade agreements with other nations gradually eroded Puerto Rico's competitive advantages. Moreover, instead of investing in the island, U.S. companies brought their profits back to the mainland. \nIn 1976, the U.S. tried again, sweetening the pot for companies with Section 936 of the Federal Tax Reform Act. That created new jobs in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and electronics, but at huge fiscal cost as mainland corporations gamed tax laws. When the U.S. phased out the tax breaks, the island's manufacturing employment took a big hit -- a blow that Puerto Rico's legislators are quick to blame for the island's decline, not least because it conveniently absolves them for their own bad decisions. \nThe Republican-controlled U.S. Congress is now debating what to do about Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal mess. The island's top officials have all but begged for the ability to restructure the debt of its municipalities under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code \u2013 a power Puerto Rico had for decades until Congress took it away . Better yet would be the ability also to restructure its general obligation debt, which it can\u2019t realistically pay. \nCongress seems unlikely to allow restructuring. Instead, the Republican majority wants to impose a fiscal control board that takes over Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs. Analysts at Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for a New Economy have argued against this approach's \"colonial and imperialistic overtones,\" which also contradict the GOP's devolutionary, small-government philosophy. Instead, they advocate passing a \"fiscal responsibility law\" with strict enforcement provisions. \nAs smart as this idea looks on paper, the island\u2019s repeated failures to put its own fiscal house in order undermine that case. On the other hand, imposing a control board without granting debt relief risks accelerating Puerto Rico\u2019s downward spiral. \nThat brings us back to the central question of Puerto Rico\u2019s sovereignty. A control board for Puerto Rico would be all-too-consistent with its quasi-colonial status: Its legislators and executives behave irresponsibly in part because the buck doesn't stop with them. The island depends on the federal government for a quarter of its revenues, on terms that Washington sets, while it's straightjacketed by federal regulations that hurt its competitiveness and estrange it from neighboring economies. \nMaking Puerto Rico a state wouldn't necessarily cure it of bad fiscal behavior (see: Illinois). And independence would bring huge challenges. But remaining a commonwealth isn't working either. More than a half-century after JFK called Puerto Rico a \"source of hope and inspiration,\" its predicament should be a source of shame for every American. Its U.S. citizens have rates of poverty and unemployment that dwarf those on the mainland, and diminishing prospects that make a mock of the American Dream. They don't even enjoy the full benefits of the U.S. Constitution. \nTheir lot won't fundamentally improve until they seize control of their own destiny and choose between statehood or independence. And when they finally make that choice, Congress should honor it, either welcoming Puerto Rico as the 51 st state or allowing it to be independent. \nOnce Cuba gained its independence from U.S. control in 1902, it became theoretically free to make its own mistakes, notwithstanding the colossus to the north looking over its shoulder. And Lord knows Cuba made plenty of them, even before its current detour through socialist privation and repression. Over the years, Cuba has nonetheless delighted in tweaking Uncle Sam in the United Nations over Puerto Rico\u2019s \"colonial\" status, and is doubtless enjoying some quiet schadenfreude over its neighbor's troubles. \nYet these two islands can lift each other up. In addition to their shared history and culture, they face some similar demographic and economic challenges, and have some complementary strengths -- Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry and Cuba's nascent biotechnology sector, for instance. An unlikely partnership, perhaps. But as President Obama has noted about Cuban policy, we know what hasn't worked. Maybe it's time to try something different for Puerto Rico too.

The Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, won't stop talking about them. Sanders has proudly adopted the label of a \"democratic socialist,\" and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American future. In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \"freedom\" means... they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity. Sen. Bernie Sanders At a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October, Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what \"democratic socialism\" means to him. \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway,\" Sanders said, \"and learn what they have accomplished for their working people.\" Read More A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST \"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\" \"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PST While the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system. \"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\" But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports. \"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%. But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are onlylightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net. Houses stretch along a canal in Copenhagen The recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world. Over the past few years, studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street Journal, the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actuallymore economic freedom than the United States. \"There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true,\" said Bo Lidegaard, the executive editor-in-chief of Politiken , one of Denmark's leading newspapers. \"If by socialist you mean regulated, restrictive, the individual is not free to do what she or he wants, that is not what we have here. We have a society where the individual is perhaps freer than any other society because the government is securing the social contract so comprehensively.\" In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \"socialist\"--even a \"democratic socialist\"--as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades. \"When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it's a little bit 1970s,\" said Lars Christensen, a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homeland's model. \"The major political parties on the center-leftand the center-rightwould oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\" Could the U.S. adopt the Danish model?

Its U.S. citizens have rates of poverty and unemployment that dwarf those on the mainland, and diminishing prospects that make a mock of the American Dream. They don't even enjoy the full benefits of the U.S. Constitution. \nTheir lot won't fundamentally improve until they seize control of their own destiny and choose between statehood or independence. And when they finally make that choice, Congress should honor it, either welcoming Puerto Rico as the 51 st state or allowing it to be independent. \nOnce Cuba gained its independence from U.S. control in 1902, it became theoretically free to make its own mistakes, notwithstanding the colossus to the north looking over its shoulder. And Lord knows Cuba made plenty of them, even before its current detour through socialist privation and repression. Over the years, Cuba has nonetheless delighted in tweaking Uncle Sam in the United Nations over Puerto Rico\u2019s \"colonial\" status, and is doubtless enjoying some quiet schadenfreude over its neighbor's troubles. \nYet these two islands can lift each other up. In addition to their shared history and culture, they face some similar demographic and economic challenges, and have some complementary strengths -- Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry and Cuba's nascent biotechnology sector, for instance. An unlikely partnership, perhaps. But as President Obama has noted about Cuban policy, we know what hasn't worked. Maybe it's time to try something different for Puerto Rico too.

      "text": "OUR MOBILE APPS iOS Android THE BLOG New Study: Sanders' Tax Wall Street Plan Would Raise $300 Billion, Create Millions of New Jobs 03/21/2016 02:31 pm ET Rose Ann DeMoro Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses Association \nNew research findings from a team of progressive economists provides documentary evidence that the financial footing for Sen. Bernie Sanders visionary social change agenda is not only plausible, but would create far more socially productive jobs, as well as moving us down the road to the more humane society that is at the heart of the Sanders campaign. \nIn their push to vilify Sanders, Democratic Party acolytes from the media to academia have fallen in line attacking the economic foundations of his campaign for free public college tuition, Medicare for all, job creation through infrastructure repair, and other critical needs. \nBut a new report from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute documents how a key Sanders proposal - a tax on Wall Street speculation -would bring at least $300 billion a year in new revenues from those who can most afford to pay it for the critical reforms the country so desperately needs. \nSen. Sanders with National Nurses United members at the introduction of his College for All Act funded by a tax on Wall Street speculation \nFurther, the report by Robert Pollin, lead author, and his colleagues James Heintz and Thomas Herndon, breaks new ground in documenting that the tax would be a huge boon to the economy in creating millions of new jobs in education beyond what the same spending creates on Wall Street. \nAnd contrary to the critics would not dampen productive investment, which has fallen sharply under the reckless Wall Street behavior of recent decades. \nTaxing Wall Street speculation to finance free public college tuition, as Sanders talks about on the campaign trail, and has introduced in legislation, S 1373, the College for All Act, could create a net expansion of 4.2 million jobs. Not to mention securing equal educational opportunity for everyone, regardless of background or ability to pay. \nInvesting in education produces more than 8 times the number of jobs created by the same spending in financial services, the authors explain. \nThis finding parallels a 2009 National Nurses United study that found conversion to a Medicare for all health care system, as Sanders also proposes, would create millions of new, good paying jobs, as would a green economy as Pollin documented in his 2012 book \"Back to Full Employment.\" \nSimply put, a socially productive economy, from education to healthcare to renewable energy is also a job creation engine. \nThe report's second ground breaking finding is that taxing Wall Street speculation would not harm productive investment in the economy, as the Wall Street shills constantly allege. \nSince the 1970s, with the escalation of a neoliberal program of decimation of our manufacturing sector with outsourcing, globalization, and the domination of the financial sector of the economy, there has been an 18-fold increase in Wall Street trading over productive investment in the economy, Pollin, Heintz and Herndon reveal. \nAs the authors note Wall Street speculation \"has not delivered\" in \"investments in physical plants and machinery that can deliver technical innovations (that) raise overall productivity.\" \nIn other words, the idea that the speculation tax would harm productive investments in a corporate dominated economy through outsourcing, unfair trade pacts from NAFTA to the Trans Pacific Partnership proposal, and domination by Wall Street, that has long abandoned manufacturing jobs at home and harmed millions of working class families is nonsense. \nFor those new to the idea of a speculation tax, or as nurses call it, the Robin Hood tax, is explained by Pollin, Heintz and Herndon. \nA simple tax of $5 in every $1,000 of stock trades, $1 on the trading of a $1,000 bond, and a mere 5 cents on the trades of derivatives, \"such as a stock option, in which the value of the underlying asset, i.e. the stock itself, is worth $1,000.\" \nCompare that to the average sales tax in the U.S. of 8.4 percent, or $84 on every $1,000 most Americans pay on nearly every consumer item, from shoes to tooth paste. \nFurther, the cost falls almost entirely on trading done by the biggest Wall Street high rollers - think Lehman Brothers or Goldman Sachs - the very people who tanked our economy by reckless gambling with people's mortgages and pensions. \nAnd, raise at least $300 billion a year, not from regular Americans who make occasional stock trades, but from the Wolves of Wall Street who make thousands or millions of trades a day, often through computerized algorithms. \nIndividuals with annual incomes under $50,000 and families under $75,000 a year are exempted through the two bills Sanders has introduced, S 1371, the Inclusive Prosperity Act, which parallels a companion House measure, HR 1464, introduced by Rep. Keith Ellison. \nNo surprise, Wall Street moguls, and their surrogates in the media and Washington, hate it. They don't want any restraints on their profiteering and stranglehold on the economy. But, shamefully, many in the liberal and Democratic Party elite, from Hillary Clinton to her surrogates in the Democratic National Committee and Congress have also attacked Sanders social change agenda as \"pie in the sky.\" \nEven though a similar tax is in place in most of the world's major financial markets, is in the process of implementation in the European Union, and actually existed in the U.S. for the first half of the last century. \nFar from the fear mongering here, a Wall Street tax is achievable, it would have an enormous salutary effect on our economy, and help lead the way to a program of such critical needs as education and health care for all, good paying jobs, and forceful action on the climate crisis - just as Bernie Sanders proposes.

      "text": "Story highlights Police conduct raids around Brussels for people linked to the attacks, state broadcaster reports Authorities in New York, Washington, Chicago and L.A. step up patrols after Brussels attacks Two explosions ripped through the Brussels Airport, and another happened at a subway station Brussels, Belgium (CNN) Three explosions that ripped through the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday killed at least 34 people and wounded about 170 more, according to Belgian media, and raised the reality of terror once again in the heart of Europe.\n\"We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters.\nBelgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport.\nAfter the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks.\nCiting judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks.\nRead More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.\nBrussels under attack: Live updates\n20 photos: Terror attacks in Brussels An injured woman leaves the Brussels airport after at least two explosions rocked the facility Tuesday, March 22.

Not in my backyard.\"\nEurope, U.S. on alert as well\nBelgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport.\nThis comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs.\nIn addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside.\nThe ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well.\nAs far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon.\nSimilar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe.\nEurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels.\nUPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station.\n\u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium.\n\"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\"\nBritish police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard.\n1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport.\n\u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\n\"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\"\n\"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\"\nAirport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down\nThe darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building.\n\"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN.\nBarrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded.\nIn the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\"\nCNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added.\n\"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\"\nTraveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint.\nHe says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways.\nSoccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity'\nAbout an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station.\nPeople wounded outside #maelbeek #metro #brussels @cnnireport #brusselsattacks #maalbeek pic.twitter.com/JaqUEOz7Tl\n\u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks.\n\"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\"\nJUST WATCHED Subway witness: We fled through smoke Replay More Videos ...

We will do everything we can to help.\n\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) March 22, 2016 Abdeslam, who authorities say was involved in the Paris terror attacks last year, was arrested in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek on Friday.\nBelgium's Prime Minister deflected a question about whether there's any link between Tuesday's bloodshed and Abdeslam's capture, saying it is too early to tell.\nHe said Tuesday that he had \"no information\" about who was responsible for the attack, adding that authorities will find that out, but right now their focus is on caring for the victims.\nBelgian national soccer team captain Vincent Kompany tweeted that he was \"horrified and revolted (that) innocent people (are) paying the price again,\" but he urged people not to encourage those wishing to lash out.\n\"We must reject hate and its preachers,\" Kompany said. \"... I wish for Brussels to act with dignity.\"\nFollow Joshua Berlinger on Twitter",

      "text": "Police conduct raids around Brussels for people linked to the attacks, state broadcaster reports Authorities in New York, Washington, Chicago and L.A. step up patrols after Brussels attacks Two explosions ripped through the Brussels Airport, and another happened at a subway station Brussels, Belgium (CNN) Three explosions that ripped through the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday killed at least 34 people and wounded about 170 more, according to Belgian media, and raised the reality of terror once again in the heart of Europe. \"We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters. Belgian federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said late Tuesday morning that it was too soon to know exactly how many people died in the bombings. Yet Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing emergency services, reported 20 dead at the Maalbeek metro station and 14 more killed at Brussels' international airport. After the blasts -- which came days after the capture of Europe's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody police raid -- Belgian authorities again hit the streets looking for those tied to Tuesday's carnage and who might launch more attacks. Citing judicial sources, RTBF reported that raids were underway midday Tuesday around Brussels, targeting people linked to the attacks. Read More At least one of the two airport explosions was a suicide bombing, Van Leeuw said. A blast happened there outside the security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.

Hide Caption 20 of 20 The subway station blast happened in the Brussels district of Maalbeek, near the European quarter, where much of the European Union is based. Richard Medic, who arrived at the station shortly after that explosion, wasn't surprised by the carnage after all that Europe has gone through recently, including the November's massacre in Paris that ISIS claimed responsibility for. \"I think, after the Paris attacks, we were assuming like this would happen,\" the Brussels resident told CNN. \"And it was a matter of time.\" Yet Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when the blasts occurred, said that he thinks Belgians should not hole themselves up and instead should continue to travel \"to prove that we're not afraid of those who have done (the attacks).\" That doesn't mean being in the middle of it all, though, isn't frightening. \"You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,\" Versele told CNN. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\" Europe, U.S. on alert as well Belgian authorities bolstered security after Tuesday's attacks, including shutting down all Brussels metro stations and evacuating the city's airport. This comes as the terror threat level in Belgium went up four -- its highest. That step-up means that army soldiers can be sent onto the streets to meet security needs. In addition to the airport, Belgium's Royal Palace was evacuated after the attacks. And broadcaster RTBF reported the National Pensions Office in Brussels had also been cleared after two suspicious packages were found inside. The ramifications were felt outside the Belgian capital as well. As far away as the United States, authorities in places like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles took special precautions like increased K9 sweeps of subways and additional police patrols. This was especially true around airports, subway stops and train stations, with scenes like those in the U.S. capital -- where police pulled out and checked travelers at random -- not uncommon. Similar, if not more intense measures were enacted around Europe. Eurostar, a high-speed railway that goes to England and France, noted a number of schedule and other changes, including canceling service between London and Brussels. UPDATE: No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station. \u2014 Eurostar (@Eurostar) March 22, 2016 NATO, the military alliance that is headquartered in Brussels, increased its own alert level and expressed solidarity with Belgium. \"This is a cowardly attack, an attack on our values and on our open societies,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Terrorism will not defeat democracy and take away our freedoms.\" British police have increased their presence at certain locations, including transport hubs like London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to Scotland Yard. 1/2 As a result of the terrible incidents in Brussels, there will be increased police and security patrols in and around Gatwick Airport. \u2014 Gatwick Airport LGW (@Gatwick_Airport) March 22, 2016 And France deployed 1,600 more police around the country, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve. \"I express my entire solidarity with the Belgian people,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted . \"Through the Brussels attacks, the whole of Europe has been hit.\" That sentiment was echoed by Belgium's Michel during what he called \"a dark time for our country.\" \"More than ever, I call on everybody to show calm, but also solidarity,\" the Prime Minister said. \"We are facing a difficult, challenging time. And we should face up to this challenge by being united.\" Airport witness: Windows broken, ceiling parts down The darkness set in not long after the sun rose in Brussels. Anthony Barrett said he heard something about 8 a.m. local time from his hotel across from the terminal building. \"When I opened the curtains and looked out, I could see people fleeing,\" he told CNN. Barrett saw stretcher after stretcher carrying people out of the airport, with luggage trollies also used to transport the wounded. In the airport's departure hall, Versele noticed \"people ... shouting and running around\" after the first blast, then even more pandemonium after the second explosion, which was, \"in my eyes, much more powerful.\" CNN Map That blast blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added. \"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 people on the floor seemingly unable to walk. \"... It was quite a mess.\" Traveler Jeffrey Edison had cleared security and was out by the gate, several hundred yards from the departure lounge, where the explosions occurred. He told CNN he didn't hear the blasts but \"suddenly saw\" 200 to 300 people rushing toward him from the security checkpoint. He says it took authorities around 25 minutes to tell the passengers what had happened, before evacuating the area and leading the passengers to the runways. Soccer star: 'I wish for Brussels to act with dignity' About an hour later, during the tail end of Brussels' rush hour, another blast went off at the Maalbeek metro station. \u2014 dirk alaerts (@dirkalaerts) March 22, 2016 Sander Verniers was heading toward there when this explosion occurred, producing \"strong winds going (through his train) and some noises that shouldn't be there.\" Belgian troops met the passengers as they got off the train and walked along the tracks. \"We all had to get out,\" Verniers told CNN. \"There was a lot of smoke.\" JUST WATCHED",

      "text": "SHARE Martin Barraud\u2014Getty Images A million isn't what it used to be. But it's not bad, and here's how you get there. \nA million bucks isn\u2019t what it used to be. When your father, or maybe you, set that savings goal in 1980 it was like shooting for $3 million today. Still, millionaire status is nothing to sniff at\u2014and new research suggests that a broad swath of millennials and Gen-Xers are on the right track. \nThe \u201cemerging affluent\u201d class, as defined in the latest Fidelity Millionaire Outlook study, has many of the same habits and traits as today\u2019s millionaires and multimillionaires. You are in this class if you are 21 to 49 years of age with at least $100,000 of annual household income and $50,000 to $250,000 in investable assets. Fidelity found this group has five key points in common with today\u2019s millionaires: Lucrative career: The emerging affluent are largely pursuing careers in information technology, finance and accounting\u2014much like many of today\u2019s millionaires did years ago. They may be at a low level now, but they have time to climb the corporate ladder. High income: The median household income of this emerging class is $125,000, more than double the median U.S. household income. That suggests they have more room to save now and are on track to earn and save even more. Self-starters: Eight in 10 among the emerging affluent have built assets on their own, or added to those they inherited, which is also true of millionaires and multimillionaires. Long-term focus: Three in four among the emerging affluent have a long-term approach to investments. Like the more established wealthy, this group stays with its investment regimen through all markets rather than try to time the market for short-term gains. Appropriate aggressiveness: Similar to multimillionaires, the emerging affluent display a willingness to invest in riskier, high-growth assets for superior long-term returns. \nBecoming a millionaire shouldn\u2019t be difficult for millennials. All it takes is discipline and an early start. If you begin with $10,000 at age 25 and save $5,500 a year in an IRA that grows 6% a year, you will have $1 million at age 65. If you save in a 401(k) plan that matches half your contributions, you\u2019ll amass nearly $1.5 million. That\u2019s with no inheritance or other savings. Such sums may sound big to a young adult making little money. But if they save just $3,000 a year for seven years and then boost it to $7,500 a year, they will reach $1 million by age 65. \nAn emerging affluent who already has up to $250,000 and a big income can do this without breaking a sweat. They should be shooting far higher\u2014to at least $3 million by 2050, just to keep pace with what $1 million buys today (assuming 3% annual inflation). But they will need $6 million in 2050 to have the purchasing power of $1 million back in 1980, when your father could rightly claim that a million dollars would make him rich. ",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

      "text": "OUR MOBILE APPS iOS Android THE BLOG New Study: Sanders' Tax Wall Street Plan Would Raise $300 Billion, Create Millions of New Jobs 03/21/2016 02:31 pm ET Rose Ann DeMoro Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses Association \nNew research findings from a team of progressive economists provides documentary evidence that the financial footing for Sen. Bernie Sanders visionary social change agenda is not only plausible, but would create far more socially productive jobs, as well as moving us down the road to the more humane society that is at the heart of the Sanders campaign. \nIn their push to vilify Sanders, Democratic Party acolytes from the media to academia have fallen in line attacking the economic foundations of his campaign for free public college tuition, Medicare for all, job creation through infrastructure repair, and other critical needs. \nBut a new report from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute documents how a key Sanders proposal - a tax on Wall Street speculation -would bring at least $300 billion a year in new revenues from those who can most afford to pay it for the critical reforms the country so desperately needs. \nSen. Sanders with National Nurses United members at the introduction of his College for All Act funded by a tax on Wall Street speculation \nFurther, the report by Robert Pollin, lead author, and his colleagues James Heintz and Thomas Herndon, breaks new ground in documenting that the tax would be a huge boon to the economy in creating millions of new jobs in education beyond what the same spending creates on Wall Street. \nAnd contrary to the critics would not dampen productive investment, which has fallen sharply under the reckless Wall Street behavior of recent decades. \nTaxing Wall Street speculation to finance free public college tuition, as Sanders talks about on the campaign trail, and has introduced in legislation, S 1373, the College for All Act, could create a net expansion of 4.2 million jobs. Not to mention securing equal educational opportunity for everyone, regardless of background or ability to pay. \nInvesting in education produces more than 8 times the number of jobs created by the same spending in financial services, the authors explain. \nThis finding parallels a 2009 National Nurses United study that found conversion to a Medicare for all health care system, as Sanders also proposes, would create millions of new, good paying jobs, as would a green economy as Pollin documented in his 2012 book \"Back to Full Employment.\" \nSimply put, a socially productive economy, from education to healthcare to renewable energy is also a job creation engine. \nThe report's second ground breaking finding is that taxing Wall Street speculation would not harm productive investment in the economy, as the Wall Street shills constantly allege. \nSince the 1970s, with the escalation of a neoliberal program of decimation of our manufacturing sector with outsourcing, globalization, and the domination of the financial sector of the economy, there has been an 18-fold increase in Wall Street trading over productive investment in the economy, Pollin, Heintz and Herndon reveal. \nAs the authors note Wall Street speculation \"has not delivered\" in \"investments in physical plants and machinery that can deliver technical innovations (that) raise overall productivity.\" \nIn other words, the idea that the speculation tax would harm productive investments in a corporate dominated economy through outsourcing, unfair trade pacts from NAFTA to the Trans Pacific Partnership proposal, and domination by Wall Street, that has long abandoned manufacturing jobs at home and harmed millions of working class families is nonsense. \nFor those new to the idea of a speculation tax, or as nurses call it, the Robin Hood tax, is explained by Pollin, Heintz and Herndon. \nA simple tax of $5 in every $1,000 of stock trades, $1 on the trading of a $1,000 bond, and a mere 5 cents on the trades of derivatives, \"such as a stock option, in which the value of the underlying asset, i.e. the stock itself, is worth $1,000.\" \nCompare that to the average sales tax in the U.S. of 8.4 percent, or $84 on every $1,000 most Americans pay on nearly every consumer item, from shoes to tooth paste. \nFurther, the cost falls almost entirely on trading done by the biggest Wall Street high rollers - think Lehman Brothers or Goldman Sachs - the very people who tanked our economy by reckless gambling with people's mortgages and pensions. \nAnd, raise at least $300 billion a year, not from regular Americans who make occasional stock trades, but from the Wolves of Wall Street who make thousands or millions of trades a day, often through computerized algorithms. \nIndividuals with annual incomes under $50,000 and families under $75,000 a year are exempted through the two bills Sanders has introduced, S 1371, the Inclusive Prosperity Act, which parallels a companion House measure, HR 1464, introduced by Rep. Keith Ellison. \nNo surprise, Wall Street moguls, and their surrogates in the media and Washington, hate it. They don't want any restraints on their profiteering and stranglehold on the economy. But, shamefully, many in the liberal and Democratic Party elite, from Hillary Clinton to her surrogates in the Democratic National Committee and Congress have also attacked Sanders social change agenda as \"pie in the sky.\" \nEven though a similar tax is in place in most of the world's major financial markets, is in the process of implementation in the European Union, and actually existed in the U.S. for the first half of the last century. \nFar from the fear mongering here, a Wall Street tax is achievable, it would have an enormous salutary effect on our economy, and help lead the way to a program of such critical needs as education and health care for all, good paying jobs, and forceful action on the climate crisis - just as Bernie Sanders proposes.

      "text": "MUST WATCH CNN Hero Dr. Jim Withers: Street medicine 03:08 For 23 years, Withers has been treating the homeless -- under bridges, in alleys and along riverbanks. CNN Heroes \nFor more about CNN Heroes, go to CNNHeroes.com \"We realized that this was something that could be addressed. We could make 'house calls,' \" he said. It's something that Withers' father, a rural doctor, often did. Withers' one-man mission became a citywide program called Operation Safety Net . Since 1992, the group has reached more than 10,000 individuals and helped more than 1,200 of them transition into housing. In addition to street rounds, the program has a mobile van, drop-in centers and a primary health clinic, all where the homeless can access medical care. Canceled California wedding helps feed the homeless Today, Withers is also fostering a global \"street medicine\" movement. His nonprofit, the Street Medicine Institute , supports communities in starting programs of their own. Its network includes dozens of teams in the United States and around the world. I recently talked with Withers about his work and his ultimate vision. Below is an edited version of our conversation: CNN: How does it work, doing rounds in homeless camps? Dr. Jim Withers: It can be a challenge to keep up with where the camps are. The homeless are often evicted. Their belongings are taken. And so they have to keep moving. And therefore we have to keep moving to keep up to date on their camps. Withers and a student treat Lois Burkes, who his organization helped find housing. Doing walking rounds, we try to keep our team down to four people. We don't want to invade (their space) with a lot of people. It's their home. So there's an outreach expert who knows the field and knows the people. There's myself or a medical person, and then we always have a student or two. And we bring a social worker with us. We'll go into the camp, and we make sure they're OK with us coming in. Almost all the homeless are cordial, if not downright really friendly. And we just join them, and they can express what's going on. We always try then to check in with how they're doing medically. If they have insurance, if they have medicines that they should be on that they ran out of. Do they have a doctor? \"Did you get that looked at?\" What's important to the patient, the person, is our priority. The care that we deliver out there is dependent on what's in our backpacks. We try to emphasize that this is not good enough. Getting (them) into primary care is our goal. Dr. Withers in his own words CNN: What ailments do you see out there? Withers: People on the street, they're exposed to the elements obviously. So you see a lot of things that have to do with the weather and the difficulties of sleeping out there: frostbite, dehydration, hypothermia. But they also have everyday things, like high blood pressure, diabetes, coughs and colds, pneumonia, injuries. 25 photos: 2015 CNN Heroes Giving needy a lift \u2013 All of the 2015 CNN Heroes show how one person can truly make a difference.

It was like going to a third-world country. Dr. Jim Withers We've seen people with cancers. We've seen liver failure, people who needed dialysis that we actually took to dialysis from the street. It goes on and on and on. We've seen almost everything that I've seen clinically and a few things that I hadn't. So it's a very rich environment for medical teaching, unfortunately. CNN: You consider the streets to be a kind of classroom for students. What is their experience? Withers: I see it in the eyes of the students that I take out. They see how many people are living in places that you'd never want to live. The weather, the rain, the cold. I think they also get the chance to see success. When they can see a street person succeed and not just get locked in that hopeless category, their vision changes. The street classroom really ignites, or reignites, what their passion is. They feel like, \"Yes, this is what it's about.\" And they carry that forward. I think the lessons the homeless can teach us about finding the humanity and listening to people are transcendent in all of health care. A plaque under a Pittsburgh highway commemorates the homeless men and women who have died. Our students, I like to think of them as viruses. And we're spreading them out and they're beginning to go to their medical residencies, and they're saying, \"Do you have street medicine here?\" or \"Why aren't you going under bridges?\" And so the dialogue is really spreading. CNN: What's your hope for the future? Withers: In the way I'd like to see things, every person who is still on the streets will have medical care that comes directly to them and says, \"You matter.\" And I'd love to see every medical school have a classroom of the streets. I've dedicated myself as much as I can to finding anyone, anywhere, who's interested in doing medical care to their own street people and helping them. Besides just the good that it does and the money that it saves, having street medicine in every community transforms us. We begin to see that we're all in this together. It's something that we should take pride in when we can actually treat people the way we would want to be treated. Want to get involved?

      "text": "Watch Seth Meyers explain what happened in Kansas when taxes were cut dramatically 2:10 a.m. ET \nIt's not every day that small business owners ask for their taxes to be raised, but that's what's happening in Kansas. \nAs Seth Meyers explains, Gov. Sam Brownback (R) cut taxes for the wealthy and eliminated income taxes for small businesses, saying it would be a \"real live experiment\" for conservative economic policies. \"That's a terrible sales pitch for something,\" Meyers quipped. \"Those words only usually show up in shady classified ads.\" Supporters said the cuts would somehow generate $323 million in new revenue, but they actually produced a $688 million loss, and the state got creative when it tried to close the gap, at one point taking adult items seized from a business that owed back taxes and auctioning them off online. \nNow, residents are complaining about budgets being slashed and business owners are rejecting the drastic tax cuts, leading Meyers to believe the results of the experiment are in. \"Republicans want to replicate these policies on a national level, but even when you buy couch cleaner they tell you to try it on a small patch of fabric first,\" he said. \"That's what happened here \u2014 Kansas was the small patch of fabric. Not only did the cleaner not work, the couch exploded.\" Watch the (in some parts racy) video below. Catherine Garcia \nSamantha Bee takes a moderate whack at GOP Supreme Court obstruction, and a poke at Joe Biden 2:14 a.m. ET \nEver since Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly, Senate Republicans \"have made it clear that they're going to hold the Supreme Court hostage like a Mexican housekeeper locking Richard Simmons up in the crawl space,\" Samantha Bee said on Monday's Full Frontal . President Obama \"fulfilled his constitutional duty to troll the Republicans soooo hard\" by naming a moderate nominee, Merrick Garland, that many of them had just lauded, Bee said, showing a clip of Fox News pundits freaking out over Obama's \"trap.\" But Senate Republicans were ready with some trolling of their own. \nTheir first gambit was repeating \"the Biden Rule\" ad nauseam to justify their court-blocking. \"Ah, yes, the Biden Rule that totally exists,\" Bee said. \"What is the Biden Rule again?\" After showing a brief clip of Biden saying something stupid, she rolled the video of him talking about judicial appointments \u2014 but she played all the relevant parts . \"Oh, so Color Me Bad\u2013era Biden said he'd support a moderate nominee from President Bush,\" Bee said. \"That's so great! If that's the rule, let's get on with moderate Merrick's hearing \u2014 tick tock, you don't stop.\" \nBut Republicans had a backup catch-phrase: Lame-duck Obama. \"He's not a lame duck \u2014 he's three trimesters away from from lame-duckery,\" Bee protested. \"A president's term is four years. You can't say only three of those are legitimate and the fourth is garbage \u2014 they're not Indiana Jones movies.\" Finally, she found one Republican senator, Jeff Flake (Ariz.), willing to consider confirming Garland, at least if Hillary Clinton wins. Bee took her poke at the vice president, and Flake: \"Oh, dude! Did you just embarrass your party by blurting out the thing you're not supposed to say in public? Finally, someone following the actual Biden Rule!\" Watch below. Peter Weber Sign Up for 10 things you need to know today Today's best articles Today's top cartoons Daily business briefing Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nTed Cruz's campaign would love to get Marco Rubio on a unity ticket, but his former rival doesn't share the enthusiasm, multiple sources told Politico . \nWanting to block Donald Trump from the nomination, Cruz is looking at all of his options, the sources say, and one senator willing to work as a middleman between the Cruz and Rubio camps is Mike Lee (R-Utah). He tried to get a meeting with Rubio before the Florida primary, which Rubio lost to Trump, but was rebuffed, Politico reports. Undeterred, Cruz's team spent the last week conducting polls in upcoming primary states to see how he would do running with Rubio, the sources said. If nothing else, Cruz's campaign would like a Rubio endorsement, and those close to Rubio say he's open to it, particularly if he thinks Cruz has a shot at beating Trump. \nOn Fox News Monday night, Cruz said he hasn't talked about a unity ticket with Rubio, but isn't ruling it out. \"I think any Republican would naturally have Marco on their short list and you would look seriously to him as a vice presidential choice,\" he said.

Ted Cruz\u2019s tax plan, which is to virtually eliminate the IRS and tax code , to be replaced by a simple flat tax, would also see increases in take-home pay for all tax-paying brackets, with the average $55,000 worker bringing home an extra $55 per biweekly check. Advertisement - story continues below \nCruz\u2019s plan is also alleged to add to the federal deficit, to the tune of $8.6 trillion over 10 years, but again, that number could be discounted and changed by the implementation of other economy-motivating policies. \nSelf-declared socialist and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has unabashedly called for higher taxes on everyone, even the working class poor, in his efforts to redistribute all of the wealth and end income inequality by making everyone equally poor. The prototypical $55,000 worker would see a nearly $150 decrease in their paycheck. \nDespite the dramatically increased tax rates and ostensibly increased tax revenues, Sanders\u2019 plan would still add to the federal deficit as well, due to the fact that he would likely make few, if any cuts to the budget, and would instead add more government programs and spending, such as for truly universal single-payer health care and free college for everyone, among other handouts.

Back in the 1960s, heroin users were usually young men, who started using around an average age of 16. They were most likely from low-income neighborhoods, and when they turned to opiates, heroin was their first choice. Now, more than 50 years later, a study from JAMA paints a very different picture. Today's typical heroin addict starts using at 23, is more likely to live in the affluent suburbs and was likely unwittinglyled to heroin through painkillers prescribed by his or her doctor. While heroin is illicit and opioid pills such as oxycontin are FDA-approved, each is derived from the poppy plant. Their chemical structures are highly similar and they bind to the same group of receptors in the brain. (A few opioids, like fentanyl, are totally synthetic but designed to bind with those same receptors). Read More In any case, the various drugs produce the same result: an increase in pain tolerance and a sense of euphoria, along with drowsiness, occasional nausea and, at higher doses, a slowing of the user's breathing. All these drugs trigger \"tolerance\" -- the need to take higher doses for the same effect -- and a craving for the drug in its absence. It is precisely because there are so many similarities that pain pill addictsfrequently turn to heroin when pills are no longer available to them. Heroin is usually cheaper than prescription drugs. Opiate pain medications cost the uninsured about $1 per milligram; so a 60-milligram pill will cost $60. You can obtain the equivalent amount of heroin for about one-tenth the price . This may be news to you, but it's likely not to some of your neighbors, friends and family members. Last year, the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte spent time trying to better understand the patients who were coming into detox for heroin. What they found were cops, lawyers, nurses and ministers who came from some of the best neighborhoods in the area. Most of them shared a common story: \"We used to take pills, but now we inject heroin.\" For years, we have been railing about the flagrant abuse of pain pills in the United States. Former President Bill Clinton called me a couple years ago after he lost two friends to accidental prescription drug overdose. As we dug into the issue together, we were stunned to learn 80% of the world's pain pills are consumed in the United States, which has just 5% of the world's population. As a result, accidental prescription drug overdose is now the leading cause of acute preventable death for Americans. Someone dies in this manner every 19 minutes. That is more deaths than from car accidents. The response to these tragic statistics has been gratifying and effective, but somewhat shortsighted. Doctors have been less willing to prescribe medications, especially in states like Florida, formerly known for its pill mills, where tighter restrictions on prescribers led to a 23% drop in overdose deaths between 2010 and 2012. The drugs themselves have been tweaked as well. In August 2010, an abuse deterrent version of Oxycontin was released to great fanfare. It was reformulated so it could not as easily be crushed or solubilized so abusers would have a difficult time injecting or snorting it. Within two years, the choice of oxycontin as a drug of abuse went from 35.6% to 12.8% . That was the good news. The bad news is that the same study showed heroin use nearly doubled. It became apparent that drug abusers weren't going to stop as a result of government crackdowns or new technologies. They were simply morphing into people who abused other drugs. Oxycontin used to be called the hillbilly heroin. Society and technology helped fix that problem. But addicts started turning back to real heroin instead. A spokeswoman with the National Institute on Drug Abuse told us recently that nearly half of young people who inject heroin say they abused prescription opioids before turning to the illegal drug. The headlines are horrifying and for good reason. The abuse of opiate pills and heroin are both taking a tremendous toll on the United States. They are leading to increased crime, decreased productivity and they're stealing the lives of too many people . While it is nearly impossible to pit one evil against another, it is important to remember that heroin, as a street drug, is unregulated, often impure and usually injected. As a result, heroin users suffer from collapsed veins, abscesses, infections of the heart lining and valves, and rheumatological diseases. From sharing needles, they are more likely to suffer from HIV, Hepatitis and other blood diseases. And just like their pill popping counterparts, they die of overdose in shocking numbers. Some countries are more willing than the United States to pursue a strategy of harm reduction -- that is, to steer addicts away from the most dangerous types of behavior. A number of countries have implemented programs that actually provide heroin to addicts; some studies (PDF) show that doing so improves addicts' health and reduces their use of other illicit drugs. Marijuana laws may reduce painkiller deaths Yet in general, the U.S. strategy has not been harm reduction, but to target users and doctors. While all of this was unexpected, it was likely also predictable. Medication or drugs aren't the problem; it's the intrinsic behavior of human beings. We don't need to treat the drugs we are taking; we need to treat the drug addiction we are suffering. Like the people who take the pills in the first place, society wanted a quick fix. Instead of treating the core cause of drug addiction, we implemented blanket policies to restrict the medications, alter them and place them increasingly out of reach. Yet human beings are smart, and it was easy to reach for something on a lower shelf, more easily accessible. Make no mistake, the crackdown on opiates was a good thing, but there have been unintended consequences. On one side, patients with legitimate pain have been caught in the crossfire, easily dismissed as malingerers and unable to get relief. On the other side, abusers have become more creative, turning to heroin to feed their addiction. We must work to make sure treatment for drug addiction is a pillar of drug policy in the United States. We already know that it can work at levels similar to the effects of treatment of other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma. Good doctors don't focus on the symptoms of a disease; they want to ultimately treat the disease itself. If we do the same here, we can rid America of this awful drug habit, and save many lives in the process. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div>",

      "text": "The Essential Guide to Writing a Business Plan Today's Most Read \nLearn how to invest your IRA or 401k into a franchise penalty-free. ($50k min) Image credit: Startup Stock Photos Martin Zwilling \nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, \u201cIn preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.\u201d If you\u2019re starting a business, you should have a business plan regardless of whether you\u2019re bootstrapping it or looking for outside funding. \nThe best sorts of business plans tell a clear story of what the company plans to do and how it will do it. Given the high failure rate of startups in their first year, a business plan is also an ideal opportunity to safely test out the feasibility of a business and spot flaws, set aside unrealistic projections and identify and analyze the competition. \nA business plan doesn\u2019t need to be complicated, but for it to serve its purpose and set you up for success, it must be clear to whomever is reading your plan that you have a realistic handle on the why and how your business will be a success. \nTo get you moving in the right direction, here\u2019s a guide on how to write a business plan. Overall tips \nThere\u2019s a lot of advice in the infosphere about how to write a business plan, but there\u2019s no single correct way. Your approach depends on your industry, who is reading your plan and what the plan is intended for. Are you trying to get funding? Sara Sutton Fell, founder of FlexJobs , a job site for flexible telecommuting jobs, says her business plan was an initiator for more in-depth conversation with potential investors. \u201cA plan does help to see if investors and entrepreneurs are on the same page with general expectations for the business,\u201d she says. \nA business plan serves many purposes, but there is universal consensus on the following when it comes to your business plan: \nHave several versions tailored for specific audiences: \u201cOne of the mistakes that inexperienced business owners make is not understanding who they\u2019re writing the plan for,\u201d says David Ciccarelli, a small business owner who got consultation from his local Small Business Association (SBA) when he was starting his company Voices.com , which connects employers with voiceover talent. \nYour plan is a living document: Tim Berry, the founder of a business planning software company Palo Alto Software , took his company from zero to $5 million in sales in its first three years. To do so requires frequent review and close tracking, says Berry, who met with his management team every month to review the plan versus what actually happened -- and then to revise. \u201cThere is no virtue to sticking to a plan if it\u2019s not useful and responsive to what actually happens,\u201d he cautions. \nBe realistic about financial estimates and projections: \u201cWhen you present a plan to bankers and financiers, or even to your employees, people will get way more excited about what\u2019s real rather than some huge thing that\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d says Ciccarelli. So present an achievable sales forecasts based on bottom-upwards information (i.e. how many units per month get sold in how many stores) and stop over projecting profits. \nWriting your business plan is about the process and having a blueprint: Your business plan \u201creflects your ideas, intuitions, instincts and insights about your business and its future,\u201d according to Write Your Business Plan (Entrepreneur, 2015). The plan serves as a safe way to test these out before you commit to a course of action. And once you get your business going, the plan also serves as a reference point. \u201cI still print the document,\u201d says Ciccarelli. \u201cYou\u2019re capturing it in time. If you\u2019re changing it all the time, you kind of don\u2019t remember where you were last year.\u201d \nBack up any claims: Follow up your projections and assertions with statistics, facts or quotes from a knowledgeable source to lend your plan credibility. \nPresentation counts: Reading any long, text-heavy document is hard on the eyes, so format with this in mind. Consider formatting your text pages into two-columns and break up long passages with charts or graphs. Arial, Verdana or Times New Roman are standard industry fonts. \nWriting your business plan isn\u2019t busy work or a luxury; it\u2019s a vital part of the process of starting a business and arms you with information you need to know. So, let\u2019s get into what information goes into your business plan. \nRelated: Bu siness Plans: A Step-by-Step Guide What goes into a business plan? \nA typical business plan is 15 to 25 pages. Its length depends on a variety of factors, such as whether your business is introducing a new product or belongs to a new industry (which requires explanation to the reader), or if you\u2019re pitching to bankers, who generally expect to see a traditional written business plan and financials. \n\u201cMost equity investors prefer either an executive summary or pitch deck for first contact, but will often request a more detailed plan later in the due diligence process. Potential customers don\u2019t need all the details of your internal operation. Your management team needs access to everything,\u201d says Akira Hirai, managing director of business plan consulting service Cayenne Consulting . \nMost business plans include these seven sections: \n1. Executive summary : The executive summary follows the title page and explains the fundamentals of your business. It should provide a short and clear synopsis of your business plan that describes your business concept, financial features and requirements (i.e. cash flow and sales projections plus capital needed), your company\u2019s current business position (i.e. its legal form of operation, when the company was formed, principals and key personnel) and any major achievements in the company that are relevant to its success, including patents, prototypes or results from test marketing. \n2. Business description : This section typically begins with a brief description of your industry and its outlook. Get into the various markets within the industry, including any new products that will benefit or hurt your business. For those seeking funding, reinforce your data with reliable sources and footnote when possible. Also provide a description of your business operation\u2019s structure (i.e. wholesale, retail or service-oriented), who you will sell to, how you will distribute your products/services, the products/services itself (what gives you the competitive edge), your business\u2019s legal structure, your principals and what they bring to the organization. \nHere are some worksheets from Write Your Business Plan that will help determine your unique selling proposition and analyze your industry. Click to Enlarge+ \n3. Market strategies: Here is where you define your target market and how you plan to reach them. Market analysis requires research and familiarity with the market so that the target market can be defined and the company can be positioned (i.e. are you a premium product or a price-competitive product?) in order to garner its market share. Analyze your market in terms of size, structure, growth prospects, trends and sales/growth potential. This section also talks about distribution plans and promotion strategy and tactics that will allow you to fulfill your plans. \nHere is a worksheet from Write Your Business Plan that will guide you toward identifying your target market. Click to Enlarge+ \n4. Competitive analysis: The purpose of the competitive analysis is to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors within your market, strategies that will provide you with a distinct advantage, the barriers that can be developed in order to prevent competition from entering your market, and any weaknesses that can be exploited within the product development cycle. Show why your business will be a success over others. \n5. Design and development plan: You will only need this section if you have a product in development, such as an app. The purpose of this section is to provide investors with a description of the product's design, chart its development within the context of production and marketing and show a development budget that will enable the company to reach its goals. \n6. Operations and management plan: This section describes how the business functions on a daily basis, its location, equipment, people, processes and surrounding environment. If you have a product that needs to be manufactured, explain the how and where; also, describe your work facility, the personnel, the legal environment (such as licensing, permits, special regulations, etc.), key suppliers and inventory. This section will also highlight the logistics of the organization such as the various responsibilities of the management team and the tasks assigned to each division within the company. \n7. Financial factors: Financial data is always at the back of a business plan -- yet it\u2019s extremely important. The financial data can include your personal financial statement, startup expenses and capital, your projected cash flow statement and 12-month profit-and-loss statement. PaloAlto\u2019s Berry stresses that if you\u2019re going after investors, you\u2019ll need to show a cash flow statement and a break-even analysis -- or the breakdown to see where your business breaks even. \nThe best way to prepare for running a business is to have all the components of the plan ready. So if you are are showing a prospective lender your business plan on 10 PowerPoint slides and get asked about something that isn\u2019t in the presentation, you can speak knowledgeably and follow up with a more fleshed out plan -- and quickly. \nSome business owners hire business plan writing services. Cayenne Consulting\u2019s Hirai says that his clients generally fall into one of two categories: those intimidated by the process and those who could write the plan themselves but would prefer to spend their time on other priorities. \nIf you find yourself intimidated or stuck, you can always write the parts of plan yourself that you understand and hire a consultant or researcher to help with parts that you find confusing. \nOr if you\u2019re a startup watching every dollar, then tap the free services of the federal Small Business Association (SBA). Every state has a district office . Through the SBA, you can get business plan assistance through its various resource partners, which includes Women's Business Centers , Small Business Development Centers and Service Corps of Retired Executives . \nAllow this business plan template for Business Plan for a Startup Business to guide you: Different types of business plans \nGenerally, business plans can be divided into four categories : \nWorking plan: This plan is what you will use to operate your business and is not meant to be admired. This version of your plan is an internal document and will be long on detail, short on presentation. Here, you can omit descriptions that you need not explain to yourself or your team. \nMini plan: The reader may request a mini plan, or a condensed version of your business plan (1-10 pages), which includes most of the same components as in a longer traditional plan -- minus the details and explanation. This includes the business concept, financing needs, marketing plan, financial statements (especially cash flow), income project and balance sheet. This shorter plan is not meant to be a substitute for a full-length plan, but serves as an option to present to potential partners or investors. \nPresentation plan: Whether you\u2019re using a pitch deck or a written business plan, the information in your presentation plan will be, more or less, the same as in your working plan but worded differently and styled for the eyes of an outsider. The reader of your presentation plan will be someone who is unfamiliar with your business, such as investor or venture capitalist, so lose any jargon or shorthand from your working plan, which only makes sense to you. Also, keep in mind that investors will want to see due diligence on your competition threats and risks as well as financial projections. In addition, looks count, so use the color printer, a nice cover and bindings and the fancy paper stock. Or else, if you\u2019re presenting your business plan as a PowerPoint presentation, you can use this business plan presentation template . \nWhat-if plan: This is a contingency plan -- in case your worst case scenario happens, such as market share loss, heavy price competition or defection of a key member of your team. You want to think about what to do in the face of an of these, and if you\u2019re trying to get outside funds, having a contingency plan shows that you\u2019ve considered what to do if things don\u2019t go according to plan. You don\u2019t necessarily need this, but if you are getting outside funding, then it can strengthen your credibility showing that you have thought about these what-if possibilities. Even if you\u2019re not going to get outside funding, shouldn\u2019t you be thinking of the what ifs? \nIf four plans seem like a mountain of work, don\u2019t panic. Select two to start off -- a working plan and a mini plan, which will be an abbreviated version of your working plan. \nTake several months to write your business plan. Consider it a journey, not a sprint. ",

      "text": "Vision Statements: Why You Need One and How to Create One Image credit: Shutterstock November 3, 2015 \nJoin us live at Entrepreneur's Accelerate Your Business event series in Chicago or Denver. Secure your spot \u00bb \nIn The Marketing Plan Handbook , author Robert W. Bly explains how you can develop big-picture marketing plans for pennies on the dollar with his 12-step marketing plan. In this edited excerpt, Bly describes the importance of having a vision statement and how it can help you develop a marketing plan that helps you bring in more business. \nThere's a key aspect to the planning of marketing campaigns that differs depending on whether you're a corporate marketing manager or a small-business owner. The former has to please only their employer; the latter seeks to create a business that rewards them personally as well as financially, delivering both the in\u00adcome and the lifestyle they seek. \nFor a marketing manager who's not a business owner, the objective of a marketing plan is pretty much the same for every company they work for: to create and implement a campaign that maximizes return on marketing dollars (ROMD). In other words, to generate the maximum sales and profits for every dollar spent on marketing. \nBut for the business owner, there's an added dimension to the planning process: vision. By this, we mean creating a marketing plan that not only maximizes ROMD but also delivers the lifestyle the owner wants to get from their business. \nTo create a marketing plan that enables you to live this lifestyle, you need a clear vision of what your ideal lifestyle would be. For instance, I'm a workaholic who puts in 12-hour days and has a relatively large work output. But I have colleagues in the businesses I'm in\u2014freelance copywriting and information products\u2014for whom working only a few hours each day is paramount. Naturally, our businesses look wildly different, with our marketing plans tailored to achieving our goals and vision. What Is Your Vision? \nYour vision\u2014or your \u201cmission statement\u201d\u2014declares where your business is headed and what it will look like when it's arrived. A mission statement tells you what success (for you) looks like. How else will you know when you\u2019ve achieved it? Your marketing plan refocuses everything you do in your business into a series of planned, coordinated actions that enables your business to deliver both the income and the lifestyle you seek from it. \nTo write a marketing plan for your business that enables you to achieve optimum reward both at work and at home, you need to visualize what you want in both venues. At work, do you want to be part of a team of bright, creative, enthusiastic professionals? Or do you dream of spending the day alone at your PC, in quiet and solitude, writing programs or balancing numbers on spreadsheets? At home, is it important that you are the envy of your friends and neighbors for your obvious wealth, living in the biggest, fanciest home on the block, or driving the most expensive cars? Do you desire with all your being to dine in five-star restaurants and join the best clubs? Or is your idea of happiness grilling franks and hamburgers with neighbors in your backyard? Think about your ideal day. What does it look like? How would you envision your tasks, your overall productivity? \nWhy is a vision important for a small business? Because it forces you to really know your ambitions for your business. A vision can't be vague. It declares the outcomes you expect and becomes a guiding light that will lead your business forward. So make sure your vision statement clearly states the outcomes you intend to create. \nHere are a few examples of actual vision statements: Microsoft (original) : \u201cA personal computer in every home running Microsoft software.\u201d eBay : \u201cTo provide a global trading platform where practically anyone can trade practically anything.\u201d North Point Church : \u201cTo create a church that unchurched people love to attend.\u201d Canadian Cancer Society : \u201cCreating a world where no Canadian fears cancer.\u201d Amazon : \u201cTo be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover any\u00adthing they might want to buy online.\u201d Milwaukee Public Library : \u201cEvery person\u2019s gateway to an expanding world of information. Providing the best in library service, we guide Milwaukeeans in their pursuit of knowledge, enjoyment, and lifelong learning, ultimately enriching lives and our community as a whole.\u201d Bowling Inc. : \u201cMore people, bowling more often, having more fun.\u201d Write Your Vision Statement \nIt\u2019s time to create your own vision statement. Don\u2019t worry about trying to make it perfect. What\u2019s important at this point is to begin the conversation with yourself about the business you\u2019re trying to create. Do this no matter how long you\u2019ve been in business. \nBegin with a clean sheet of paper. Imagine your business three to five years in the future, and answer the following questions. What service(s) do you perform? What products do you sell? For whom? (What types of clients? If you have specific clients in mind, list them.) Where is your business located? Do you work at home or in an office? Describe everything. You\u2019ve just met yourself on the job. What do you do in the business? Are you an owner or a hands-on employee? Do you render the actual service clients buy or hire employees to do that while you manage and master\u00admind your business? What is your life like? What about your life makes you happy? How much do you and the business earn? (The amounts won\u2019t be the same.) Do you have employees? If so, how many? What do they do? What value do they add to the business? What skills and training do they have? Be as specific as possible. What does this business look like when you sell it or turn it over to rela\u00adtives? What does this business do better than any other? What are you known for? What makes you unique or different from your competitors? What is your unique selling proposition (see sidebar)? How do you feel about this business? What inspires you about this busi\u00adness? What are the four or five keywords you use when describing your business to others? What are the words your clients use when describing what you do for them to others? \nNow, pull out the strongest words in your descriptions. Look for those words that trigger emotions for you. What jumps out for you? What words generate anticipation and passion when you read them on the paper? These words inspire you, and they belong in your vision statement. Your words should reference the type of client you serve, the service you provide, and the geographic coverage of your service. Now go write your vision statement. ",

      "text": "True North By rejecting $1 billion for a pipeline, a First Nation has put Justin Trudeau's climate plan on trial \nCanada\u2019s Lax Kw\u2019alaams show us how we can be saved: by loving the natural world and local living economies more than mere money and profit Indigenous leaders gather on Lelu island where the Lax Kw\u2019alaams First Nation has set up camp to protest the construction of the Petronas LNG terminal. Photograph: SkeenaWatershed Coalition Sunday 20 March 2016 18.20 GMT Last modified on Sunday 20 March 2016 18.23 GMT \nEverything has a price. Everyone can be bought. We assume this principle is endemic to modern life \u2014 and that accepting it is most obvious to the impoverished. Except all over the world, people are defying it for a greater cause. That courage may be even more contagious. \nIt has been in full supply in north-west Canada , where an oil giant is aiming to construct one of country\u2019s biggest fossil fuel developments: a pipeline to ship liquified natural gas (LNG) out of British Colombia. To export it overseas via tankers, Malaysian-owned Petronas must first win approval for a multi-billion dollar terminal on the coast. \nThat happens to be at the mouth of Canada\u2019s second-largest salmon river, on the traditional territory of the Lax Kw\u2019alaams First Nation. One of the world\u2019s longest un-dammed rivers, the Skeena abounds in the fish relied on by surrounding wildlife \u2014 and by First Nations and an entire regional economy. \nLast year, following our modern principle, Petronas offered the First Nation an offer they imagined couldn\u2019t be refused: in exchange for their support, a whopping $1.15 billion in cash. But put to a vote, the Lax Kw\u2019alaams resoundingly said \u201cno\u201d \u2014 every single community member. \nWhen Petronas made the offer, Lax Kw\u2019alaams hereditary chief Yahaan says he believed the community \u2014 poor and with few employment prospects \u2014 might vote yes. \n\u201cOpportunities like that don\u2019t come to your door every day,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I give my people credit for taking that bold step. They showed their love and their passion for the land and water. No amount of money can compare to the richness of the river and what it gives us.\u201d \nThey knew something even a billion dollars couldn\u2019t persuade them to ignore: that you couldn\u2019t pick a worse place to transform into an industrial landscape. The proposed site for the LNG plant is smack in the middle of a unique estuary, a coastal Mecca for fish: where every year hundreds of millions of young salmon, having travelled down the river after birth, feed and nurture as part of their journey to adulthood. \nWhen the British Columbia government gave Petronas a green-light anyway \u2014 ignoring the First Nation\u2019s unanimous vote and the corporation\u2019s legal duty to consult them \u2014 Yahaan and community members sprung into action. In the summer of 2015 they set up camp on Lelu island, right in the path of Petronas at the mouth of the river. Monitoring the area on boats, they peacefully turned away workers from sensitive sites. \nThe camp, still up today, is a defence not just of wild salmon and aboriginal rights. Like many such outposts manned by Indigenous peoples across Canada, it is a defence of an entire worldview. On one side stands a government \u2014 wedded to an extractivist mentality \u2014 that is bent on carving up the province with tens of thousands of fracking wells. It promises an extravagant illusion of 100,000 jobs, which in truth amount to just a few thousand that will vanish as this resource boom, like all others, goes bust. And as Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights have become more powerful, the government and its corporate partners have responded the way they know how: hiking the sums by which to buy them off. \nOn the other side, the salmon protectors, feeding tens of thousands and supporting a commercial and recreational economy crucial to British Columbians. Promoting an abundance of life instead of threatening to extinguish it. Taking care with the land so that it can take care of people. Getting by on what the earth can continually restore rather than depleting forever what lies beneath. \nThis is an Indigenous outlook, but one ever more people share. It is in sync with the knowledge that our energy sources must work not against natural cycles but with them \u2014 harnessing the power of the sun, water and wind. This can provide jobs in far greater numbers than fossil fuels. And this is the kind of economy we need more of: regenerating naturally, creating enduring local benefits, existing in balance with the natural world. It is, in other words, everything a dirty energy economy is not. \nThe most dangerous imbalance of all that would be generated by this industrial project, Yahaan says, has only deepened the community\u2019s opposition: its contribution to climate change. Far from clean, emissions from an LNG industry would shatter the provincial government\u2019s emission targets. The Petronas plant and its associated fracking alone could become the country\u2019s largest carbon polluter. \nAll this means that the courageous resistance of this First Nation has put Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s climate plan on trial. The new Liberal government \u2014 which will have final say on the project \u2014 has raised enormous expectations. And raised those of First Nations: as Trudeau has said repeatedly, \u201cgovernments grant permits, but only communities grant permission.\u201d But as he has mouthed these words, he has pledged to build pipelines and fulfill ex-Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s dream of getting fossil fuels to overseas markets. Trudeau can build LNG up, or bring down emissions: he cannot do both. Will it be on the shores of this beautiful, irreplaceable corner of the world that Trudeau\u2019s contradiction flounders? \nThe signs so far are not good. The federal government has said they\u2019ll give the same tax breaks to the LNG industry that Harper was prepared to. And on Friday they approved a smaller but controversial LNG project in southern British Columbia. And yet the government is feeling the heat of opposition: after tens of thousands of public comments criticizing the Petronas project, a decision that was to come down March 22 was delayed by Canada\u2019s Environment Minister and referred to cabinet. \nThe British Columbia government\u2019s response to date has been worse. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what science the forces of no bring together up there except that it\u2019s not really about the science,\u201d Premier Christy Clark declared. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about the fish. It\u2019s just about trying to say no. It\u2019s about fear of change. It\u2019s about a fear of the future.\u201d \nIt must have been a complete fluke for the \u201cforces of no\u201d that the results of a study assessing the project were published in Science, one of the world\u2019s premier academic journals. Its conclusion? The LNG plant could lead to the collapse of BC\u2019s wild salmon run. \nIt must be another coincidence that the government\u2019s own scientific studies showed , already 40 years ago, that any development in this region could \u201ccompletely destroy\u201d the river\u2019s complex ecosystem. \nAnd still yet another coincidence that the government\u2019s current studies continue to point out the problems with an LNG industry: its emissions, in a worse case scenario, \u201cwould be comparable to those from Alberta\u2019s oilsands.\u201d \nThe provincial government\u2019s denigration has a different purpose: laying the grounds to marginalize and criminalize its Indigenous opposition. Yahaan says the RCMP who escorted Petronas workers regularly threatened community members patrolling in boats. \u201cThey said they were watching us from land, air, and water. A police sergeant told me, \u2018we could have ripped anyone out of those boats, but we didn\u2019t want to make it seem like we were protecting the corporations.\u2019\u201d \nIn the face of this, support for the Lax Kw\u2019alaams has only been growing. In January, several neighbouring Indigenous nations, locals non-native groups and opposition politicians signed onto the Lelu Declaration, a powerful call from the First Nation to protect the area from industrial development and hold it in trust for generations to come. \nTheir stance is a challenge not just to Trudeau. It is a challenge to all those who choose to side with the extractive economy that offers security in the short-run but guarantees peril in the long-term. Last year, I sat in a meeting where activists from around the country debated how to propel us to the next economy. After a labour unionist pleaded for caution when it came to risking the jobs of the oil industry, an Indigenous leader named Arthur Manuel stood up. \u201cLook at the example of Lax Kw\u2019alaams,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, the poorest communities in Canada, turn down money all the time.\u201d If this First Nation can find the courage to risk another way, what excuse do the rest of us have? \nThese Indigenous \u201cforces of no,\u201d derided by Christy Clark, ignored by Justin Trudeau, have taken to calling themselves by another name: the Forces of Know. They hold a few things certain, but one could not be more fundamental. It is that their approach, anchored in ancient knowledge and arched toward a habitable future, is how the world can be saved: by loving the natural world and living economies more than mere money and profit.

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

Hide Caption Story highlights Jay Parini: Clinton has high negatives after decades in positions of authority But, he asks, is there any real reason to hate someone who would be one of the most qualified presidents in recent times? Some of the hate is sexist, some is fear from Republicans who consider her a strong candidate, Parini says Jay Parini , a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and is the author of \" Empire of Self: A Life of Gore Vidal. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Before I got out of bed this morning, my wife asked: \"Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?\" Although I voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, my senator from Vermont, I don't dislike Clinton in the least. Quite the opposite. I will happily vote for her in November. Excruciating choice for GOP leaders: Take risk on Trump? She is an admirable public servant, despite her obvious flaws, which are mostly the consequence of her decades in positions of authority. Every coin has two sides. Her work as first lady certainly gave her a close view of life in the Oval Office -- a time of \"daring and hubris,\" according to The New York Times' Peter Baker and Amy Chozick, when she learned how the levers of power work. Having served as a U.S. senator for eight years, she knows how Congress functions -- or doesn't. And she has a vast comprehension of foreign affairs, having visited 112 countries during her years (2009 to 2013) as secretary of state -- more than any previous person in that post. Clinton's achievements Read More Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning. Dirty campaigning? He perfected it. And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings , in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of \"Why don't they like you?\" Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.\" As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points. Rampant misogyny Ex-death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty (opinion) It's perhaps too easy to blame sexism for the nastiness that colors the opposition to Clinton. Yet one sees misogyny bubbling out in the comments section of articles on the Web, where no sentiments -- however crude -- are off limits. They attack her voice, her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her laugh. On and on. Even in the mainstream, one hears misogynistic comments, as when Tucker Carlson said of Clinton on MSNBC: \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" or when Rand Paul said, \"I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes -- one for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.\" Clinton gets slammed for \" shouting \" and not smiling enough, though these are criticisms we don't hear about the male candidates. The main thing to dislike about Hillary Clinton seems to be her gender, and one can only begin to imagine the kind of language Donald Trump will summon in the general election. Supreme Court pick: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics Serious criticism of Clinton does arise. Some believe, for instance, that she doesn't tell the truth. Or that she's beholden to Wall Street. Or that she got four people killed in Benghazi. Others insist that she played fast and loose with her emails, risking national security and breaking the law. I myself would fault her for pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya: That hawkishness worries me. Regime change is not our business, and I would hope she has learned this lesson. Yet it makes no sense for people to hate her. Truth-telling She does shade the truth at times, as do all politicians, including Sanders. Politifact , an excellent website, measures the truth-quality of statements by everyone running for president on both sides of the aisle, and Clinton comes out as perhaps the most truthful of the pack, even more so than Sanders -- although the two are more or less even, telling the whole truth or something like the truth about half the time. (By contrast, only 9% of the statements made by Donald Trump and reviewed by Politifact were rated \"true\" or \"mostly true.\" More than three quarters of Trump's statements were rated \"mostly false,\" \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") As for Wall Street: The financial industry has supplied roughly 3.9% of Clinton's funding, or 7% if you count money from related PACs. She did, of course, make a fair number of speeches to big banks -- though by no means did the bulk of her income as a speaker derive from those speeches. And what did Wall Street get for its money? Not much. In the Senate, she voted for TARP, the Bush plan to bail out the banks. But this was a wise move, in my view, helping to rescue an economy in free fall. She argued from the floor: \"For two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\" She has, in fact, called for a tax on high frequency trading , the sort of maneuvering that puts people's retirement savings at risk. Not perfect, but smart and experienced In general, Clinton has been fairly sympathetic to Wall Street and willing to work with it, even help it at times. This annoys some on the left. But do we really want a president who hates Wall Street, which is the engine house of our economy? I don't think so. Hillary is winning but Bernie Sanders is no loser (Opinion) Make no doubt about it: Clinton remains a liberal Democrat. She and Sanders actually voted \"the same way 93% of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate,\" according to an analysis done by The New York Times. She is, plainly, more centrist than Sanders on most issues -- but the differences between them are hardly vast. The main reason that Republicans, in particular, hate Clinton is that she will probably beat Trump or Cruz or anyone thrown up by the GOP in the general election. The abuse of Hillary Clinton must stop. She's not perfect. But she's smart, experienced and compassionate, and she will step into the Oval Office better prepared to take on an exacting job in difficult times than almost anyone in recent memory.",

A contactless system will likely entrench poverty and pave the way for terrifying levels of surveillance \u2018Cash empowers its users. It enables them to buy and sell, and store their wealth, without being dependent on anyone else.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy Dominic Frisby Monday 21 March 2016 09.30 GMT Last modified on Monday 21 March 2016 09.32 GMT \nT he health food chain Tossed has just opened the UK\u2019s first cashless cafe . It\u2019s another step towards the death of cash. \nThis is nothing new. Money is tech. The casting of coins made shells, whales\u2019 teeth and other such primitive forms of money redundant. The printing press did the same for precious metals: we started using paper notes instead. Electronic banking put paid to the cheque. Contactless payment is now doing the same to cash, which is becoming less and less convenient. In the marketplace convenience usually wins. \nThat\u2019s fine as long as people are making this choice freely. What concerns me is the unofficial war on cash that is going on, from the suspicion with which you are treated if you ever use large sums of cash to the campaign in Europe to decommission the \u20ac500 note . I\u2019m not sure the consequences have been properly considered. \nRelated: Salad for one, served by machine? That\u2019s the saddest modern recipe | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett \nWe already live in a world that is, as far as the distribution of wealth is concerned, about as unequal as it gets. It may even be as unequal as it\u2019s ever been. My worry is that a cashless society may exacerbate inequality even further. \nIt will hand yet more power to the financial sector in that banks and related fintech companies will oversee all transactions. The crash of 2008 showed that, when push comes to shove, banks have already been exempted from the very effective regulation that is bankruptcy \u2013 one by which the rest of us must all operate. Do we want this sector to have yet more power and influence? \nIn a world without cash, every payment you make will be traceable. Do you want governments (which are not always benevolent), banks or payment processors to have potential access to that information? The power this would hand them is enormous and the potential scope for Orwellian levels of surveillance is terrifying. \nCash, on the other hand, empowers its users. It enables them to buy and sell, and store their wealth, without being dependent on anyone else. They can stay outside the financial system, if so desired. \nThere are many reasons, both moral and practical, to want this. In 2008 many rushed to take their money out of the banks. If the financial system really was as close to breaking point as we are told it was, then such actions are quite justified. When Cyprus\u2019s banks teetered on the cliff of financial disaster in 2011, we saw bail-ins. Ordinary people\u2019s money in deposit accounts was sequestered to bail out the system. If your life savings were threatened with confiscation to bail out a corporation you considered profligate, I imagine you too would rush to withdraw them. \nWe have seen similar panics in Greece and, to a lesser extent, across southern Europe. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, recently declared that banking was not fixed and that we would see financial panic again. In Japan, the central bank has imposed negative rates and you are charged by banks to store money. This is to try and goad people into spending, rather than saving. So much cash has been withdrawn from banks that there are now reports that the country has sold out of safes. \nThese are all quite legitimate reasons to want to exit the system. I\u2019m not saying we should all take our money out of the bank, but that we should all have the option to. Cash gives you that option. Why remove it? It\u2019s our money. Not the banks\u2019. \nThe telephone teaches us a useful lesson. At its peak in 2008, there were 1.3bn landlines for a global population close to 7 billion. Today more than 6 billion people have a mobile phone \u2013 more than have access to a toilet, according to a UN study. Many assume that the mobile succeeded where the landline failed, because the superior technology made widespread coverage more possible. There is something to that. \nBut the main reason, simply, is that, to get a landline, you need a bank account and credit. About half of the world\u2019s population is \u201cunbanked\u201d, without access to the basic financial services you need. Telecoms companies saw no potential custom, the infrastructure was never built and many were left with fewer possibilities to communicate. But a mobile phone and its airtime you can buy with cash. You don\u2019t need to be banked. Almost anyone can get a mobile \u2013 and they have. The financial system was actually a barrier to progress for the world\u2019s poor, while cash was a facilitator for them. \nSix billion people around the world will have a smartphone by 2020. They will have pretty much everything they need to participate in e-commerce \u2013 internet access, basically \u2013 except the financial inclusion. Which is why there will be a huge role to play in the future for new forms of digital cash \u2013 from Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa to bitcoin \u2013 money you can use even if you are not financially included. \nRelated: No wallet, no worries: Denmark considering cash-free shops \nCash has its uses for small transactions \u2013 a chocolate bar, a newspaper, a pint of milk \u2013 which, in the UK, are still uneconomic to process by other means. It will always be the fastest and most direct form of payment there is. I like to tip waiters, for example, in cash, knowing they will receive that money, without it being siphoned off by some unscrupulous employer. I also like to shop in markets, where I can buy directly from the producer knowing they will receive the money, without middle men shaving off their percentages. \nIt also has its uses for private transactions, for which there are many possible reasons, and by no means all of them illegal. Small businesses starting out need the cash economy. Poor people need the cash economy. The war on cash is a war on them. \nIf you listen to the scaremongering, you\u2019d start to think that all cash users are either criminals, tax evaders or terrorists. Sure, some use cash to evade tax, but it\u2019s paltry compared to the tax avoidance schemes Google and Facebook have employed. Google doesn\u2019t use cash to avoid tax. It\u2019s all done via legislative means. \nCash means total financial inclusion, a luxury the better-off take for granted. Without financial inclusion \u2013 and there will always be some who, for whatever reason, won\u2019t have it \u2013 you are trapped in poverty. So beware the war on cash. ",

      "text": "Questions and Answers \nTired of the crazy politics and government interference or social permissiveness? Has your tax burden become more than you can bear? If you've ever thought that if people just did it your way, things would be much better...we have good news: you can start your own micronation! It's not easy, but it's also not impossible, and we'll show you how to do it. We'll also show you some successes, some failures, and the very real future of nation building. Ad Steps 1 Learn about your country. It makes sense to learn about your country before you go off making a new one. 2 Make your plans. Write what it's name is, The capital(s), State or province names, Language(s). You can think about it.If possible make a custom National flag, song(s), anthem(s), symbol(s). 3 Know the rules. As Bob Dylan said, \"to live outside the law you must be honest.\" The same thought holds true for forming a micronation: to make your own rules you must follow established rules and conventions. Much of the basis for current nation building comes from the 1933 Convention on Rights and Duties of States , also known as the Montevideo Convention. [1] These are the basic rules set out in Article 1 of the Convention: The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications : A permanent population Government The capacity to enter into relations with the other states The balance of the first ten Articles go on to explain that the existence of a state is independent of recognition by other states, and is free to act on its own behalf\u2014and that no state is free to intervene in the affairs of another. Note that these are not laws in the conventional sense. You are free to declare yourself a country, anytime, and anywhere. However, nobody will take you seriously, which translates to the simple truth that you will have no legitimacy as a nation. 4 Find territory for your micronation. This is the hard part. With two exceptions, existing land has all been claimed by existing countries. The main exception is Antarctica. Even then, should you brave the weather and lack of \"population appeal,\" Antarctica is managed by the most powerful countries in the world, and it's unlikely they'll let you just plant a flag and say, \"Mine!\" Second, there is Bir Tawil, a tiny plot of land between Egypt and Sudan, which neither claim. However, there is very little appeal to this country, due to it being only a patch of sand. Also, it has been \"claimed\" by Jeremiah Heaton, and is referred to as North Sudan. [2] Still, there are things to try, to get around this earth of available dirt: Conquer an existing country. There are many small island nations dotting the Pacific, and it's unlikely they have much of a defense force. Sure, it's crazy\u2014but crazy enough that it might just work! All you need is an army, a navy, and the support of the world community\u2014many of whom protect these small nations from intruders. This has been attempted in the Comoros, Vanuatu, and the Maldives, but ultimately failed. [3] Buy an existing country. If you're wealthy enough, you can buy an island , though it's unlikely that the host nation will just cede sovereignty to you. A more corrupt or destitute country might be more easily swayed, but even that is difficult: a pack of libertarians tried to buy Tortuga from impoverished Haiti, but were rejected. There are some things money just can't buy. Find a loophole. The Republic of Indian Stream, for example, was founded on land between the U.S. and Canada that was poorly defined in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. It lasted from 1832 to 1835, when it was annexed by the U.S. Look for regions that are otherwise unproductive for the local government. Chances are that the local authority won't have any interest in keeping a disputed, resource consuming territory that is otherwise economically/politically unproductive. At this point, you might be thinking there's no hope, but we've saved the best for last. As land has become scarce, but the human need for new land continues apace, creative (and financially abundant) individuals have begun taking to the sea. 5 Build an island. The ocean, as they say, is the last great frontier. International waters are owned by no nation, and this has spurred interest and activity. The Principality of Sealand . Sealand, initially created as a military base in the North Sea, off the coast of England during World War II, is a football-field-sized structure that housed troops and weapons to strike at German invaders. After the war it was abandoned until 1966, when a rogue DJ named Roy Bates\u2014tired of battling the British government over his pirate radio station\u2014moved there to set up shop. The station never went back on the air, but he declared the floating fortress the Principality of Sealand. He raised the flag, named himself Prince, and his wife Princess Joan. Sealand withstood court challenges, and remains an independent nation to this day. Palm Island Group . While not a nation, the Palm Island Group off the coast of Dubai is indicative of the direction that holds the most promise for nation builders. Extending out into the Persian Gulf are 3 palm tree-shaped man-made islands that opulent living for the world's millionaires and billionaires. The Seasteading Institute . Founded by the grandson of Milton Friedman and PayPal founder Peter Thiel, this would-be libertarian utopian foundation believes in bringing the free market to bear on government\u2014a start-up for democracy. Their hope is that experimental, innovated governments will be able to generate new ideas of governance that will change the world. They are fostering the goal of building sea-based platforms with loose building requirements, no minimum wage, and limited restrictions on firearms. Proponents see this as a the key to the next generation of free enterprise. Critics suggest that loose building codes and low-wage workers with lots of weapons, being run by a bunch of would-be John Galts as a recipe for disaster. While the politics of the Seasteading Institute may or may not be your cup of tea, it's a fair bet that the ocean is truly the new frontier. The Republic of Minerva . One millionaire activist piled sand onto a reef located in the Pacific Ocean south of Fiji and created an artificial island to start the Republic of Minerva. [4] But if you're not rich enough to make land, then just make it up\u2014some of the more lighthearted micronations claim land on imaginary continents or planets. In addition to the traditional territory-based nation, there exists a largely untapped, unregulated, and unexplored territory that is virtually limitless\u2014because it exists only virtually. Call it the cloud, call it the web, or borrow from William Gibson and call it cyberspace, people are spending more and more time connected emotionally and interactively with their friends and colleagues through the internet. Virtual worlds such as Second Life and Blue Mars create 3-dimensional habitats, have their own currency, and their own constitutions (aka \"Terms and Conditions\"). Flatter worlds such as Facebook (aka Social Media) encourages groups of like-minded people around the world to work together for the common good\u2014as defined by the particular group. Like the ocean, virtual nations will have a growing impact, and may result in very real, separate national identities within the next 100 years. 6 Invite your friends. One of the key requirements for a nation\u2014aside from territories\u2014will be a population. If the land you conquer or build doesn't come with an indigenous people, you will have to bring your own to the party. Invite your friends and family to join you in this venture, and you will have a small, but dedicated population. These days, if you're serious about anything (and creating a micronation can be serious, indeed), then you will have a website. Use this to find like-minded people, and give them good reason to populate your new Republic. It could be for work and money, or the freedom to have many wives, or simply the opportunity to be part of the birth of a nation. You will need to decide what you require of your citizens. Do they have to pass a citizenship test, or abide by certain laws? What form of identification will they need\u2014a passport? Driver's license? Subcutaneous RFID? 7 Establish a government and a constitution. The success or failure of your venture will be determined, in large part, by your leadership in governance. Consider the success of the United States, rooted in a Constitution that is at once clear and defined, yet open to interpretation and growth. Without that, it may have fallen into disarray and dozens of small nation-states rather than an arguably united whole. Your government, and your constitution, should be guided by the principles you wish to establish from the start. Here are some examples of various micronations, and their founding principles: Nova Roma , dedicated \"to the restoration of classical Roman religion, culture and virtues\". [5] The American Empire , based on a strong sense of humor and a love of science fiction, fantasy, and games. [6] Political simulations or political movements. These micronations tend to have strong political views and are often controversial. In the past, some of them have managed to attract media or political interest, although this is rare. Despite their relative obscurity, they are some of the most common types of micronations. Cultural missions . These micronations, similar to historic projects, exist to promote a particular culture and tradition. There are many Germanic micronations such as Domanglia that attempt to recreate the culture and traditions of the former German Empire. Many of these also include nationalistic and patriotic projects. Secessionist entities . By far the most serious form of micronation, secessionist entities are often much older then other forms of micronations. Notable secessionist micronations include Sealand, the Hutt River Province, and Freetown Christinia. 8 Declare your independence. Now that you have territory, a population, and a government with a constitution, it's time to declare yourself. One of three things will happen, depending on what you have prepared for the world: A collective yawn. The world may look at your declaration of independence, and promptly go back to watching a rerun of Star Trek. A welcome into the community of nations, an invitation to a seat at the UN, and requests for ambassadors and embassies. An armed invasion. If your nation runs afoul of borders, existing treaties, human rights, or other legal protocols, you may receive anything from a knock at the door by Rent-a-Cop Officer Friendly informing you that the \"Independent Nation of 1234 N. Raynd Avenue\" is in a covenant-controlled community that does not recognize your sovereignty, and that you must to take your flag off the roof or be fined, to an all-out invasion by a United Nations coalition ordering you to stand down and please get into the bullet-proof Mercedes SUV, where you will be whisked off to The Hague to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Alternatively, your micronation could suffer the same fate as the Republic of Minerva: soon after libertarian millionaire and activist Michael Oliver created a landmass by pouring sand onto the Minerva Reefs south of Fiji, and subsequently proclaimed sovereignty, the island was invaded and annexed (with international support) by Tonga. [7] 9 Establish an economy. If you're not trading in dollars, Euros, or other currency, you will need to create your own financial system. Will you base your nation's wealth on gold, on securities, or on a whim and a prayer? While your word may count among your friends, for national debt, you will need some serious collateral for that to be of any use. If you stick to established currencies, you will still need to determine how to fund your government, and the best way to do this may be anathema to the very reason you start your own country: taxes. Through taxation, your government will be able to provide essential services such as a power grid, water lines, a necessary bureaucracy (as minimal as you like), and an army. It's a fundamental obligation for every state (small or large) to be able to defend its citizens from enemies. Whether this is a standing army, national guard, compulsory service, or some other defensive solution, this will be something to consider when creating your constitution. 10 Be recognized by the world community. Barring any untoward issues resulting from the founding of your country (see above), you will want to become a player in the world. To do this, you will need other nations to recognize you. This will require you to become adept at international law, politics, and diplomacy. If these are not among your strongest skills, you would be wise to recruit a cabinet of skilled politicos to take on this task. This is perhaps the most difficult step of all. Some nations, such as Palestine, Taiwan, and Northern Cyprus have all the checkboxes checked\u2014but are still not recognized by many countries. There are no rules here\u2014every country has their own standards by which they determine recognition. Things that could have an effect on the outcome are issues such as where you stand on Al Queda, or communism, or capitalism. They might hinge on your approach to human rights, or control of natural resources. In the United States, the decision to recognize a nation is made by the President. Your request will hinge on who occupies the White House at that time, and their policies and preferences may swing wildly every four years. Also, membership to the UN requires that none of the five powers US, UK, China, Russia and France veto your membership. In other words, you will have to have neutral stands on controversial issues like Palestine, Taiwan, Crimea, etc. If you live near or in Europe, try applying for membership to the European Union as well. This will ensure your sovereignty in world politics. 11 Manage your branding. Every country needs a flag, of course, and yours will be no different. This is the most prominent of national symbols, but there are other symbols that will help establish your identity as a nation: Money . What will your currency look like? Will it have your profile boldly embossed on gold coins, and in 3D hologram on paper money, or will you use a symbolic icon such as Lady Liberty or Charlton Heston? Will you go full-tilt modern, or attempt to hearken back to a time when each piece was carved by hand? State Seal . You can come up with a national motto and translate it into Latin. There are many free online translators. Add some florid graphics with a shield, all to suggest you're descended from royalty\u2014or you can state your mission clearly in your own language, and have a graphic designer create a logo. A good logo can be worth more than the crown jewels of England! Official correspondence . With all the letters you'll be writing to the President, the UN, the Prime Minister, and other heads of state, you'll want nice letterhead on high quality paper, embossed with your seal. National Anthem . You'll want a national anthem to play at important events. 12 Get out there and do it! The world isn't getting any bigger, and governments aren't getting any smaller (no matter what they promise), so the sooner you get out there and stake your claim. The sooner you can declare yourself Prince, King, Emperor, Ayatollah, Supreme Ruler, and President for Life of [insert your imperial dynasty here]. Reader Questions and Answers ",

The Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, won't stop talking about them. Sanders has proudly adopted the label of a \"democratic socialist,\" and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American future. In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \"freedom\" means... they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity. Sen. Bernie Sanders At a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October, Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what \"democratic socialism\" means to him. \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway,\" Sanders said, \"and learn what they have accomplished for their working people.\" Read More A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST \"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\" \"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PST While the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system. \"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\" But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports. \"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%. But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are onlylightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net. Houses stretch along a canal in Copenhagen The recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world. Over the past few years, studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street Journal, the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actuallymore economic freedom than the United States. \"There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true,\" said Bo Lidegaard, the executive editor-in-chief of Politiken , one of Denmark's leading newspapers. \"If by socialist you mean regulated, restrictive, the individual is not free to do what she or he wants, that is not what we have here. We have a society where the individual is perhaps freer than any other society because the government is securing the social contract so comprehensively.\" In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \"socialist\"--even a \"democratic socialist\"--as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades. \"When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it's a little bit 1970s,\" said Lars Christensen, a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homeland's model. \"The major political parties on the center-leftand the center-rightwould oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\" Could the U.S. adopt the Danish model?

He said, 'Are you going to start listening to me here?' Listen to the American people because the American people are roaring right now. They know government is on a morbid obesity diet and we've got to rein in the spending.\" \u2013Rep. Michele Bachmann , suggesting at a presidential campaign event in Florida that the 2011 East Coast earthquake and hurricane was a message from God (Aug. 2011) 2. \"Well what I want them to know is just like, John Wayne was from Waterloo, Iowa. That's the kind of spirit that I have, too\" -Rep. Michele Bachmann, getting her John Waynes mixed up during an interview after launching her presidential campaign in Waterloo, Iowa, where she grew up. The beloved movie star John Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa, three hours away. The John Wayne that Waterloo was home to is John Wayne Gacy, a notorious serial killer. (June 2011) 3. \"Our movement at its core is an intellectual movement.\" --Rep. Michele Bachmann on the Tea Party movement , CPAC conference, March 2014 \n4. \"Why should I go and do something like that? But the Lord says, 'Be submissive wives; you are to be submissive to your husbands.\" -Rep. Michele Bachmann, recalling in a 2006 speech at a Megachurch in Minneapolis that pursuing tax law wasn't her choice, but she did so at the urging of her husband because she was certain God was speaking through him \n5. \"If we took away the minimum wage -- if conceivably it was gone -- we could potentially virtually wipe out unemployment completely because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.\" -Michele Bachmann, Jan. 2005 6. \"I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out: Are they pro-America or anti-America?\" -Rep. Michelle Bachmann, calling for a new McCarthyism, Oct. 2008 7. \"I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out under another, then under another Democrat president , Jimmy Carter . I'm not blaming this on President Obama , I just think it's an interesting coincidence.\" -Rep. Michele Bachmann, on the 1976 Swine Flu outbreak that happened when Gerald Ford, a Republican, was president, April 28, 2009 8. \"Carbon dioxide is portrayed as harmful. But there isn't even one study that can be produced that shows that carbon dioxide is a harmful gas.\" -Rep. Michelle Bachmann, April, 2009 \n9. \"I will tell you that I had a mother last night come up to me here in Tampa, Florida, after the debate. She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter.\" \u2013Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN), on the HPV vaccine , Fox News interview, Sept. 12, 2011 \n10. \"But we also know that the very founders that wrote those documents worked tirelessly until slavery was no more in the United States. ...

Michele Bachmann, botching American history while speaking at an Iowan's for Tax Relief event in January 2011.

Michele Bachmann, while campaigning for president in South Carolina on what was actually the anniversary of Elvis's death, Aug. 16, 2011 (Elvis was born on January 8) \n\"The thing that I think that is getting a little tiresome is, the gay community thinks that they've so bullied the American people and they so intimidated politicians that politicians fear them, and so they think that they get to dictate the agenda everywhere.\" -Rep. Michelle Bachmann, CPAC conference, March 2014 \n\"I was very proud of the fact that I didn't get anything wrong that I said during the course of the debates.\" -Rep. Michele Bachmann on her performance in the 2012 Republican presidential debates",

A contactless system will likely entrench poverty and pave the way for terrifying levels of surveillance \u2018Cash empowers its users. It enables them to buy and sell, and store their wealth, without being dependent on anyone else.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy Monday 21 March 2016 10.04 GMT Last modified on Monday 21 March 2016 14.03 GMT \nT he health food chain Tossed has just opened the UK\u2019s first cashless cafe . It\u2019s another step towards the death of cash. \nThis is nothing new. Money is tech. The casting of coins made shells, whales\u2019 teeth and other such primitive forms of money redundant. The printing press did the same for precious metals: we started using paper notes instead. Electronic banking put paid to the cheque. Contactless payment is now doing the same to cash, which is becoming less and less convenient. In the marketplace convenience usually wins. \nThat\u2019s fine as long as people are making this choice freely. What concerns me is the unofficial war on cash that is going on, from the suspicion with which you are treated if you ever use large sums of cash to the campaign in Europe to decommission the \u20ac500 note . I\u2019m not sure the consequences have been properly considered. \nRelated: Salad for one, served by machine? That\u2019s the saddest modern recipe | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett \nWe already live in a world that is, as far as the distribution of wealth is concerned, about as unequal as it gets. It may even be as unequal as it\u2019s ever been. My worry is that a cashless society may exacerbate inequality even further. \nIt will hand yet more power to the financial sector in that banks and related fintech companies will oversee all transactions. The crash of 2008 showed that, when push comes to shove, banks have already been exempted from the very effective regulation that is bankruptcy \u2013 one by which the rest of us must all operate. Do we want this sector to have yet more power and influence? \nIn a world without cash, every payment you make will be traceable. Do you want governments (which are not always benevolent), banks or payment processors to have potential access to that information? The power this would hand them is enormous and the potential scope for Orwellian levels of surveillance is terrifying. \nCash, on the other hand, empowers its users. It enables them to buy and sell, and store their wealth, without being dependent on anyone else. They can stay outside the financial system, if so desired. \nThere are many reasons, both moral and practical, to want this. In 2008 many rushed to take their money out of the banks. If the financial system really was as close to breaking point as we are told it was, then such actions are quite justified. When Cyprus\u2019s banks teetered on the cliff of financial disaster in 2011, we saw bail-ins. Ordinary people\u2019s money in deposit accounts was sequestered to bail out the system. If your life savings were threatened with confiscation to bail out a corporation you considered profligate, I imagine you too would rush to withdraw them. \nWe have seen similar panics in Greece and, to a lesser extent, across southern Europe. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, recently declared that banking was not fixed and that we would see financial panic again. In Japan, the central bank has imposed negative rates and you are charged by banks to store money. This is to try and goad people into spending, rather than saving. So much cash has been withdrawn from banks that there are now reports that the country has sold out of safes. \nThese are all quite legitimate reasons to want to exit the system. I\u2019m not saying we should all take our money out of the bank, but that we should all have the option to. Cash gives you that option. Why remove it? It\u2019s our money. Not the banks\u2019. \nThe telephone teaches us a useful lesson. At its peak in 2008, there were 1.3bn landlines for a global population close to 7 billion. Today more than 6 billion people have a mobile phone \u2013 more than have access to a toilet, according to a UN study. Many assume that the mobile succeeded where the landline failed, because the superior technology made widespread coverage more possible. There is something to that. \nBut the main reason, simply, is that, to get a landline, you need a bank account and credit. About half of the world\u2019s population is \u201cunbanked\u201d, without access to the basic financial services you need. Telecoms companies saw no potential custom, the infrastructure was never built and many were left with fewer possibilities to communicate. But a mobile phone and its airtime you can buy with cash. You don\u2019t need to be banked. Almost anyone can get a mobile \u2013 and they have. The financial system was actually a barrier to progress for the world\u2019s poor, while cash was a facilitator for them. \nSix billion people around the world will have a smartphone by 2020. They will have pretty much everything they need to participate in e-commerce \u2013 internet access, basically \u2013 except the financial inclusion. Which is why there will be a huge role to play in the future for new forms of digital cash \u2013 from Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa to bitcoin \u2013 money you can use even if you are not financially included. \nRelated: No wallet, no worries: Denmark considering cash-free shops \nCash has its uses for small transactions \u2013 a chocolate bar, a newspaper, a pint of milk \u2013 which, in the UK, are still uneconomic to process by other means. It will always be the fastest and most direct form of payment there is. I like to tip waiters, for example, in cash, knowing they will receive that money, without it being siphoned off by some unscrupulous employer. I also like to shop in markets, where I can buy directly from the producer knowing they will receive the money, without middle men shaving off their percentages. \nIt also has its uses for private transactions, for which there are many possible reasons, and by no means all of them illegal. Small businesses starting out need the cash economy. Poor people need the cash economy. The war on cash is a war on them. \nIf you listen to the scaremongering, you\u2019d start to think that all cash users are either criminals, tax evaders or terrorists. Sure, some use cash to evade tax, but it\u2019s paltry compared to the tax avoidance schemes Google and Facebook have employed. Google doesn\u2019t use cash to avoid tax. It\u2019s all done via legislative means. \nCash means total financial inclusion, a luxury the better-off take for granted. Without financial inclusion \u2013 and there will always be some who, for whatever reason, won\u2019t have it \u2013 you are trapped in poverty. So beware the war on cash.",

      "text": "March 21, 2016 10:25 am \u00b7 \nTed Cruz is all about the transformative love of Jesus Christ. Through his own transformation, Cruz has learned the power of the Lord \u2014 and he plans to govern with it. The \u201cfamily values\u201d reborn Christian gets to write off anything and everything in his life before he was covered in the water of the Holy Spirit, meaning hew found the perfect political tool to excuse his indiscretions prior to his cozy relationship with the Nazarene. \nIn other words, Ted Cruz is a fraud. It doesn\u2019t matter that he was caught on camera in college talking about making a \u201cteen tit film\u201d or that he had aspirations for world domination, because Jesus. In fact, just don\u2019t ask about his early life at all. He will walk into the White House, shut the door to the Oval Office and with a sh*t-eating grin he\u2019ll ask God how to govern our country. \nThat all sounds great if you\u2019re some evangelical who believes that only someone worthy of the rapture should lead our country or just the common bible-thumper looking to get a little more religion with your government, but for the rest of us, it spells disaster. In many ways, a Ted Cruz presidency would be even worse than Donald Trump. trump may be a lunatic but he won\u2019t bother governing; he\u2019ll outsource it to the Chinese. Cruz will roll up his sleeves and destroy every decent thing progressives have accomplished in the last 200 years in favor of prayer and tax cuts for the wealthy. \nIt\u2019s for those reasons that the news from Anonymous that they have some serious evidence against Cruz\u2019s so-called good character is so encouraging: \nDoes Anonymous have the evidence they claim to have uncovered? If so, Ted Cruz can kiss his political career and quite possibly his marriage goodbye. These daunting words will surely have Cruz in a panic if there\u2019s truth to the claims: \n\u200b\u201dHave you heard of the expression \u201ccandy wrappers\u201d? Do you recall visiting prostitutes? Mr. Cruz, we are now demanding you exit this race immediately or Anonymous will release all of the information that we have found. Your so-called underground acts that you think were done in the dark, will be brought out for all the public to see. It will be sent to every media outlet to publicize your disgusting behavior. We assure you it will go viral on every social media platforms in a matter of minutes.\u201d \nAccording to the video, #opcruz is underway. It should become apparent in the next couple of days if Anonymous is actually onto something or if it\u2019s an elaborate hoax by the actions of Cruz and his campaign. He\u2019ll either ignore it, address it and blame it on the time before he found Jesus or laugh it off. One thing is certain: if it is true, Ted Cruz is shaking in his boots. \nFeatured image from Gage Skidmore / Hacked.com Share this Article! ",

A few hundred miles to the west, meanwhile, economic reforms are creating new livelihoods for self-employed Cubans, whose material conditions are improving. Buoyed by the arrival of new tourists, remittances, and foreign investments , Cuba\u2019s economy grew by 4 percent last year. \nAnd when the U.S. embargo is lifted, Cuba \u2013 which for much of the 19 th and 20 th centuries was the Caribbean\u2019s predominant economy -- is likely to take a growing bite out of Puerto Rico\u2019s fortunes, in tourism , manufacturing and services. And that's before accounting for Puerto Rico's existing fiscal straits, which will lead to shrinking government services, higher costs imposed by utilities under siege from creditors and a string of broken social promises and busted pensions. \nTrue, Cubans don\u2019t have democracy. Then again, at the national level, neither do Puerto Ricans: Despite being U.S. citizens, they can't vote for president or in Congress, which these days mostly ignores them. Cubans may face the threat of arbitrary detention and abuse. But they\u2019re much less likely than Puerto Ricans to be shot dead on the street, or to be victimized by drug traffickers or other criminals. \nIn fact, by many other yardsticks, you\u2019re better off being born in Cuba than Puerto Rico. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at the World Factbook put out by those raving socialists at the Central Intelligence Agency. Lower infant mortality? Check! Same with lower unemployment, higher literacy, and a lower overall death rate. \nThings weren\u2019t supposed to turn out this way for the island that President John F. Kennedy touted three months after the Bay of Pigs invasion as \u201ca source of hope and inspiration to those of us deeply concerned with charting new courses of social progress for our Hemisphere.\u201d \nPuerto Rico's Slide \nThe proximate cause of Puerto Rico\u2019s current distress is its crushing debt, which has tripled since 2000. And yes, irresponsible and corrupt legislators and executives (and the voters who elect them) deserve much of the blame. \nBut the larger problem has been Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with its federal overlords, who have oscillated between patronizing micromanagement and malign neglect -- devising ill-suited development strategies, granting and then revoking economic benefits, imposing regulations that undermined the island\u2019s competitiveness and creating disincentives for work. \nConsider the Washington-backed effort to turn Puerto Rico into a manufacturing hub. During the late 1940s, U.S. companies were given federal and local tax breaks to locate on the island. But U.S. minimum wage laws and trade agreements with other nations gradually eroded Puerto Rico's competitive advantages. Moreover, instead of investing in the island, U.S. companies brought their profits back to the mainland. \nIn 1976, the U.S. tried again, sweetening the pot for companies with Section 936 of the Federal Tax Reform Act. That created new jobs in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and electronics, but at huge fiscal cost as mainland corporations gamed tax laws. When the U.S. phased out the tax breaks, the island's manufacturing employment took a big hit -- a blow that Puerto Rico's legislators are quick to blame for the island's decline, not least because it conveniently absolves them for their own bad decisions. \nThe Republican-controlled U.S. Congress is now debating what to do about Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal mess. The island's top officials have all but begged for the ability to restructure the debt of its municipalities under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code \u2013 a power Puerto Rico had for decades until Congress took it away . Better yet would be the ability also to restructure its general obligation debt, which it can\u2019t realistically pay. \nCongress seems unlikely to allow restructuring. Instead, the Republican majority wants to impose a fiscal control board that takes over Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs. Analysts at Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for a New Economy have argued against this approach's \"colonial and imperialistic overtones,\" which also contradict the GOP's devolutionary, small-government philosophy. Instead, they advocate passing a \"fiscal responsibility law\" with strict enforcement provisions. \nAs smart as this idea looks on paper, the island\u2019s repeated failures to put its own fiscal house in order undermine that case. On the other hand, imposing a control board without granting debt relief risks accelerating Puerto Rico\u2019s downward spiral. \nThat brings us back to the central question of Puerto Rico\u2019s sovereignty. A control board for Puerto Rico would be all-too-consistent with its quasi-colonial status: Its legislators and executives behave irresponsibly in part because the buck doesn't stop with them. The island depends on the federal government for a quarter of its revenues, on terms that Washington sets, while it's straightjacketed by federal regulations that hurt its competitiveness and estrange it from neighboring economies. \nMaking Puerto Rico a state wouldn't necessarily cure it of bad fiscal behavior (see: Illinois). And independence would bring huge challenges. But remaining a commonwealth isn't working either. More than a half-century after JFK called Puerto Rico a \"source of hope and inspiration,\" its predicament should be a source of shame for every American. Its U.S. citizens have rates of poverty and unemployment that dwarf those on the mainland, and diminishing prospects that make a mock of the American Dream. They don't even enjoy the full benefits of the U.S. Constitution. \nTheir lot won't fundamentally improve until they seize control of their own destiny and choose between statehood or independence. And when they finally make that choice, Congress should honor it, either welcoming Puerto Rico as the 51 st state or allowing it to be independent. \nOnce Cuba gained its independence from U.S. control in 1902, it became theoretically free to make its own mistakes, notwithstanding the colossus to the north looking over its shoulder. And Lord knows Cuba made plenty of them, even before its current detour through socialist privation and repression. Over the years, Cuba has nonetheless delighted in tweaking Uncle Sam in the United Nations over Puerto Rico\u2019s \"colonial\" status, and is doubtless enjoying some quiet schadenfreude over its neighbor's troubles. \nYet these two islands can lift each other up. In addition to their shared history and culture, they face some similar demographic and economic challenges, and have some complementary strengths -- Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry and Cuba's nascent biotechnology sector, for instance. An unlikely partnership, perhaps. But as President Obama has noted about Cuban policy, we know what hasn't worked. Maybe it's time to try something different for Puerto Rico too.

      "text": "OUR MOBILE APPS iOS Android THE BLOG New Study: Sanders' Tax Wall Street Plan Would Raise $300 Billion, Create Millions of New Jobs 03/21/2016 02:31 pm ET Rose Ann DeMoro Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses Association \nNew research findings from a team of progressive economists provides documentary evidence that the financial footing for Sen. Bernie Sanders visionary social change agenda is not only plausible, but would create far more socially productive jobs, as well as moving us down the road to the more humane society that is at the heart of the Sanders campaign. \nIn their push to vilify Sanders, Democratic Party acolytes from the media to academia have fallen in line attacking the economic foundations of his campaign for free public college tuition, Medicare for all, job creation through infrastructure repair, and other critical needs. \nBut a new report from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute documents how a key Sanders proposal - a tax on Wall Street speculation -would bring at least $300 billion a year in new revenues from those who can most afford to pay it for the critical reforms the country so desperately needs. \nSen. Sanders with National Nurses United members at the introduction of his College for All Act funded by a tax on Wall Street speculation \nFurther, the report by Robert Pollin, lead author, and his colleagues James Heintz and Thomas Herndon, breaks new ground in documenting that the tax would be a huge boon to the economy in creating millions of new jobs in education beyond what the same spending creates on Wall Street. \nAnd contrary to the critics would not dampen productive investment, which has fallen sharply under the reckless Wall Street behavior of recent decades. \nTaxing Wall Street speculation to finance free public college tuition, as Sanders talks about on the campaign trail, and has introduced in legislation, S 1373, the College for All Act, could create a net expansion of 4.2 million jobs. Not to mention securing equal educational opportunity for everyone, regardless of background or ability to pay. \nInvesting in education produces more than 8 times the number of jobs created by the same spending in financial services, the authors explain. \nThis finding parallels a 2009 National Nurses United study that found conversion to a Medicare for all health care system, as Sanders also proposes, would create millions of new, good paying jobs, as would a green economy as Pollin documented in his 2012 book \"Back to Full Employment.\" \nSimply put, a socially productive economy, from education to healthcare to renewable energy is also a job creation engine. \nThe report's second ground breaking finding is that taxing Wall Street speculation would not harm productive investment in the economy, as the Wall Street shills constantly allege. \nSince the 1970s, with the escalation of a neoliberal program of decimation of our manufacturing sector with outsourcing, globalization, and the domination of the financial sector of the economy, there has been an 18-fold increase in Wall Street trading over productive investment in the economy, Pollin, Heintz and Herndon reveal. \nAs the authors note Wall Street speculation \"has not delivered\" in \"investments in physical plants and machinery that can deliver technical innovations (that) raise overall productivity.\" \nIn other words, the idea that the speculation tax would harm productive investments in a corporate dominated economy through outsourcing, unfair trade pacts from NAFTA to the Trans Pacific Partnership proposal, and domination by Wall Street, that has long abandoned manufacturing jobs at home and harmed millions of working class families is nonsense. \nFor those new to the idea of a speculation tax, or as nurses call it, the Robin Hood tax, is explained by Pollin, Heintz and Herndon. \nA simple tax of $5 in every $1,000 of stock trades, $1 on the trading of a $1,000 bond, and a mere 5 cents on the trades of derivatives, \"such as a stock option, in which the value of the underlying asset, i.e. the stock itself, is worth $1,000.\" \nCompare that to the average sales tax in the U.S. of 8.4 percent, or $84 on every $1,000 most Americans pay on nearly every consumer item, from shoes to tooth paste. \nFurther, the cost falls almost entirely on trading done by the biggest Wall Street high rollers - think Lehman Brothers or Goldman Sachs - the very people who tanked our economy by reckless gambling with people's mortgages and pensions. \nAnd, raise at least $300 billion a year, not from regular Americans who make occasional stock trades, but from the Wolves of Wall Street who make thousands or millions of trades a day, often through computerized algorithms. \nIndividuals with annual incomes under $50,000 and families under $75,000 a year are exempted through the two bills Sanders has introduced, S 1371, the Inclusive Prosperity Act, which parallels a companion House measure, HR 1464, introduced by Rep. Keith Ellison. \nNo surprise, Wall Street moguls, and their surrogates in the media and Washington, hate it. They don't want any restraints on their profiteering and stranglehold on the economy. But, shamefully, many in the liberal and Democratic Party elite, from Hillary Clinton to her surrogates in the Democratic National Committee and Congress have also attacked Sanders social change agenda as \"pie in the sky.\" \nEven though a similar tax is in place in most of the world's major financial markets, is in the process of implementation in the European Union, and actually existed in the U.S. for the first half of the last century. \nFar from the fear mongering here, a Wall Street tax is achievable, it would have an enormous salutary effect on our economy, and help lead the way to a program of such critical needs as education and health care for all, good paying jobs, and forceful action on the climate crisis - just as Bernie Sanders proposes.

Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board.\nDONALD TRUMP: New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it.\nRYAN: Thank you\u2026 We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly\u2026 Any you can share with us?\nTRUMP: Well, I hadn\u2019t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names\u2026 Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he\u2019s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that\u2019s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that\u2019s a representative group.\nFRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Do you want to start out?\nTRUMP: No, other than to say, we\u2019re working hard, I think we\u2019re all in the same business of trying to make our country better, a better place, so we have something in common. I\u2019ve been treated very, very badly by The Washington Post, but, you know, I guess \u2014 and I\u2019m your neighbor, I\u2019m your neighbor right down the road, in fact we\u2019re actually giving a press conference there in a little while, I think your people are going to be there. And by the way, Bob Costa is an excellent reporter, I\u2019ve found him to be just an excellent reporter. I should tell you, because I have to give you the good and the bad. Not that he does me any favors, because he doesn\u2019t, but he\u2019s a real professional.\nSo we\u2019re having a news conference today in the new building that\u2019s going up, and the building is very much ahead of schedule, because it was supposed to open two years from September, and we\u2019re going to open it in September. We could open it actually sooner but we\u2019re going to break it in a little bit, so we\u2019re going to open it in September, and it\u2019s under budget, even though we\u2019ve increased the quality of the finishes substantially, marble finishes, very high quality of marble, so we\u2019re under budget and ahead of schedule. And I\u2019m, you know, I am that way when I build, I know how to build, I know how to get things done.\nThe GSA [General Services Administration], I will say, GSA has been very professional, they\u2019ve been very, very professional. They chose us over\u2014I think they had more than 100 people who bid, you can imagine, because of the location, but they had over 100 people that bid, and it was broken down into ten finalists, and I got it. We got it because of the strength of my financial statement and also because of the strength of what we were proposing. So we\u2019re having a news conference there today. What time is that, Hope?\nHOPE HICKS, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON: It\u2019s at 2:15.\nTRUMP: 2:15. I hear a lot of the press is going to be there, we\u2019re going to give them a tour of the building. It\u2019s still a little bit rough \u2014 as an example, a lot of the marble surfaces all have sheetrock covering, and plywood covering on them, so a lot of people won\u2019t see as much as they think. It\u2019ll be like a miracle, you take it off and it explodes, like it\u2019s finished, right? But that\u2019ll be a fun news conference.\nHIATT: If I could, I\u2019d start by asking is there a secretary of state and a secretary of defense in the modern era who you think have done a good job? Who do you think were the best?\nTRUMP: Well, because I know so many of them, and because in many cases I like them, I hate to get totally involved. I think George Shultz was very good, I thought he was excellent. I can tell you, I think your last secretary of state and your current secretary of state have not done much. I think John Kerry\u2019s deal with Iran is one of the worst things that I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated of any kind. It\u2019s just a horrible giveaway.\nHIATT: What in particular?\nTRUMP: Well, I think, number one, we shouldn\u2019t have given the money back. I think, number two, we should have had our prisoners before the negotiations started. We should have doubled up the sanctions. We should have gone in and said, \u2018release our prisoners,\u2019 they would have said \u2018no,\u2019 and we would have said, \u2018double up the sanctions,\u2019 and within a short period of time we would have had our prisoners back. And I think that was a terrible mistake. I think giving the money back was a terrible mistake. And by the way they are not using the money on us, they are not buying anything from us, they\u2019re buying, you noticed, they didn\u2019t buy Boeing, they bought Airbus, 118 planes from what I understand, but they bought them all from Airbus, they go out of their way not to spend any money in our country. So I wouldn\u2019t have done that. And I think it\u2019s going to just lead, actually, to nuclear problems. I also think it\u2019s going to be bad for Israel. It\u2019s a very bad deal for Israel.\nHIATT: George Shultz, it\u2019s interesting, was associated with a foreign policy of Reagan that was very much devoted to promoting democracy and freedom overseas. Is that something you think in today\u2019s world the United States should be doing?\nTRUMP: I do think it\u2019s a different world today and I don\u2019t think we should be nation building anymore. I think it\u2019s proven not to work. And we have a different country than we did then. You know we have 19 trillion dollars in debt. We\u2019re sitting probably on a bubble and, you know, it\u2019s a bubble that if it breaks is going to be very nasty. And I just think we have to rebuild our country. If you look at the infrastructure \u2014 I just landed at an airport where, not in good shape, not in good shape. If you go to Qatar and if you go to (inaudible) you see airports the likes of which you have never seen before. Dubai, different places in China. You see infrastructure, you see airports, other things, the likes of which you have never seen here.\nHIATT: Short of nation building, is there any role in promoting values or democracy? Or that\u2019s not something\u2026\nTRUMP: Well, there is, I just think that we have values in our country that we have to promote. We have a country that is in bad shape, it\u2019s in bad condition. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a horrible mess. I watched Baltimore, I have many, many friends in Baltimore, we watched what happened. St. Louis, Ferguson, Oakland, it could have been much worse over the summer. And it will probably be worse this summer. But you look at some of our inner cities. And yet you know I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they\u2019d be blown up. And we\u2019d build another one and it would get blown up. And we would rebuild it three times. And yet we can\u2019t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can\u2019t build in our own country. And at what point do you say hey, we have to take care of ourselves. So, you know, I know the outer world exists and I\u2019ll be very cognizant of that but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially in the inner cities.\nHIATT: So what would you do for Baltimore, let\u2019s say.\nTRUMP: Well, number one, I\u2019d create economic zones. I\u2019d create incentives for companies to move in. I\u2019d work on spirit because the spirit is so low, it\u2019s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African American youth, is 58-59 percent. It\u2019s unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans \u2013 not youth, but African Americans \u2013 is very high. And I would create in the inner cities, which is what I really do best, that\u2019s why when I open a building and I show you it\u2019s way ahead of schedule, under budget and everything else\u2014I think it was the Rite Aid store, the store in Baltimore it took them 20 years to get it built, one store, and then it burned down in one night\u2014we have to create incentives for people to love what they are doing, and to make money. And to create, you know, to really create a better life for themselves. And you can\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem right that you will have a situation like Baltimore, and many other places, let\u2019s use Baltimore as an example, there are many Baltimores in this country. Detroit is maybe even a better example than Baltimore. But that you\u2019ll have a situation like that, and then we\u2019re over nation building with other, with countries that in many cases don\u2019t want us there. They want our money, but they don\u2019t want us.\nHIATT: The root of many people\u2019s unhappiness in Baltimore was the perception that blacks are treated differently by law enforcement. And the disproportionate \u2013 do you think it\u2019s a problem that the percentage of blacks in prison is higher than whites, and what do you think is the root of that situation?\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019ve never really see anything that \u2013 you know, I feel very strongly about law enforcement. And, you know, if you look at the riot that took place over the summer, if that were stopped \u2013 it all, it mostly took place on the first evening, and if that were stopped on the first evening, you know, you\u2019d have a much nicer city right now, because much of that damage and much of the destruction was done on Evening One. So I feel that law enforcement, it\u2019s got to play a big role. It\u2019s got to play a big role. But that\u2019s a pretty good example, because tremendous amounts of damage was done that first evening \u2013 first two evenings, but the first evening in particular. And so I\u2019m a very strong believer in law enforcement, but I\u2019m also a very strong believer that the inner cities can come back.\nHIATT: Do you see any racial disparities in law enforcement \u2013 I mean, what set it off was the Freddie Gray killing, as you know. Is that an issue that concerns you?\nTRUMP: Well, look, I mean, I have to see what happens with the trial. I\u2014\nHIATT: Well, forget Freddie Gray, but in general, do you believe there are disparities in law enforcement?\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve read where there are and I\u2019ve read where there aren\u2019t. I mean, I\u2019ve read both. And, you know, I have no opinion on that. Because frankly, what I\u2019m saying is you know we have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people to work. And you know we have lost million and millions of jobs to China and other countries. And they\u2019ve been taken out of this country, and when I say millions, you know it\u2019s, it\u2019s tremendous. I\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs, I\u2019ve seen numbers that range from 6 million to, to smaller numbers. But it\u2019s many millions of jobs, and it\u2019s to countries all over. Mexico is really becoming the new China. And I have great issue with that. Because you know I use in speeches sometimes Ford or sometimes I use Carrier \u2013 it\u2019s all the same: Ford, Carrier, Nabisco, so many of the companies \u2014 they\u2019re moving to Mexico now. And you know we shouldn\u2019t be allowing that to happen. And tremendous unemployment, tremendous. They\u2019re allowing tremendous people that have worked for the companies for a long time, they\u2019re allowing, if they want to move around and they want to work on incentives within the United States, that\u2019s one thing, but when they take these companies out of the United States. Other countries are outsmarting us by giving them advantages, you know, like in the case of Mexico. In the case of many other countries. Like Ireland is, you\u2019re losing Pfizer to Ireland, a great pharmaceutical company that with many, many jobs and it\u2019s going to move to Ireland.\nRUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST: But Mr. Trump, if I could just follow up on Fred\u2019s question. I think that what he was trying to get at was the anger in the African American community that held some of the riots and disturbances this summer about disparate treatment and about \u2026 clearly you say you\u2019ve read where there is disparate treatment. But it is pretty undeniable that there is disproportionate incarceration of African Americans vs. whites. What would you \u2013 is that something that concerns you?\nTRUMP: That would concern me, Ruth. It would concern me. But at the same time it can be solved to a large extant with jobs. You know, if we can rebuild those communities and create incentives for companies to move in and create jobs. Jobs are so important. There are no jobs. There are none. You go to those communities and you can\u2019t \u2013 there is nothing there. There is no incentive for people. It is a very sad situation. And what makes it even sadder is that we are spending so much money in other countries and our own country has vast pockets of poverty and a lot of this is caused by the fact that there are no jobs. So we can create jobs in places like Baltimore and Detroit. You know, Detroit made a move, but I don\u2019t know but it just seems to be fizzling. I don\u2019t know what is going on. I watched Detroit four, five years ago and it looked like they were really putting a full-court press on and it doesn\u2019t seem to be, from what I\u2019ve been told, friends of mine that are very much involved in that whole process that it doesn\u2019t seem to be, doesn\u2019t seem to be something that is being pursued like it should be pursued. But if we can create jobs, it will solve so many problems.\nCHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER/COLUMNIST: Can I follow up on that? I mean, to take the case of Baltimore, I mean one of the things that\u2019s so remarkable about Baltimore and Detroit is that both of these cities, like many others have been \u2013 it\u2019s not as if no one has ever said before we should have economic zones, it\u2019s not as if no one has ever said before we need incentives and taxes etc., etc. And Baltimore received a lot of federal aid over the years. So I guess the question, then, is what\u2019s different specifically about your approach to these issues from what\u2019s been tried in the past, because a lot of effort has been put in just the direction you just described.\nTRUMP: I think what\u2019s different is we have a very divided country. And whether we like it or not, it\u2019s divided as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it. I\u2018ve been, you know, I\u2019ve been doing things for a long time. I see it all the time. I mean I see it so often. I see it when we go out and we have 21,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona, the other day, the division \u2013 not so much Phoenix, because that was actually very smooth, there wasn\u2019t even a minor, they did block a road, but after that, that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division. You can see the division. There\u2019s a racial division that\u2019s incredible actually in the country. I think it\u2019s as bad, I mean you have to say it\u2019s as bad or almost as bad as it\u2019s ever been. And there\u2019s a lack of spirit. And one thing I thought that would happen, and it hasn\u2019t happened, unfortunately, I thought that President Obama would be a great cheerleader for the country. And it just hasn\u2019t happened. I mean we can say it has. But it hasn\u2019t happened. When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems. And you know there\u2019s a lack of spirit. I actually think I\u2019d be a great cheerleader \u2013 beyond other things, the other things that I\u2019d do \u2013 I actually think I\u2019d be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel it\u2019s a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit and that has not taken place. Just has not taken place.\nRYAN: Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve mentioned many times during the campaign, in fact including this morning, instances you feel where the press has been biased or unfair or outright false in their reporting, and you\u2019ve mentioned that you want to \u201copen up\u201d the libel laws. You\u2019ve said that several times.\nTRUMP: I might not have to, based on Gawker. Right?\n[CROSSTALK]\nTRUMP: That was an amazing\u2014\nRYAN: My question is not so much why you feel they should be open but how. What presidential powers and executive actions would you take to open up the libel laws?\nTRUMP: Okay, look, I\u2019ve had stories written about me \u2013 by your newspaper and by others \u2013 that are so false, that are written with such hatred \u2013 I\u2019m not a bad person. I\u2019m just doing my thing \u2013 I\u2019m, you know, running, I want to do something that\u2019s good. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know. This is a very difficult thing to do. In fact I\u2019ve always heard that if you\u2019re a very successful person you can\u2019t run for office. And I can understand that. You\u2019ll do a hundred deals, and you\u2019ll do one bad one or two bad ones \u2014 that\u2019s all they read about are the bad ones. They don\u2019t read about the one hundred and fifty great ones that you had. And even some of the ones they write that are good, they make them sound bad. You know, so I\u2019ve always heard that. I\u2019ve heard that if you\u2019re successful \u2013 very successful \u2013 you just can\u2019t run for\u2014\nRYAN: But how would you fix that? You\u2019ve said that you would open up the libel laws.\nTRUMP: What I would do, what I would do is I\u2019d \u2013 well right now the libel laws, I mean I must tell you that the Hulk Hogan thing was a tremendous shock to me because \u2013 not only the amount and the fact that he had the victory \u2014 because for the most part I think libel laws almost don\u2019t exist in this country, you know, based on, based on everything I\u2019ve seen and watched and everything else, and I just think that if a paper writes something wrong \u2014 media, when I say paper I\u2019m talking about media. I think that they can do a retraction if they\u2019re wrong. They should at least try to get it right. And if they don\u2019t do a retraction, they should, they should you know have a form of a trial. I don\u2019t want to impede free press, by the way. The last thing I would want to do is that. But I mean I can only speak for \u2013 I probably get more \u2013 do I, I mean, you would know, do I get more publicity than any human being on the earth? Okay? I mean, [ Editor\u2019s note: Trump points at Ruth Marcus ] she kills me, this one \u2013 that\u2019s okay, nice woman.\nRYAN: Would you expand, for example, prior restraints against publications?\nTRUMP: No, I would just say this. All I want is fairness. So unfair. I have stories and you have no recourse, you have no recourse whatsoever because the laws are really impotent.\nMARCUS: So in a better world would you be able to sue me?\nTRUMP: In a better world \u2014 no \u2014 in a better world I would be able to get a retraction or a correction. Not even a retraction, a correction.\nRYAN: Well, now, you\u2019ve been a plaintiff in libel suits so you know a little bit of the elements \u2026\nTRUMP: I had one basic big libel suit, it was a very bad system, it was New Jersey. I had a great judge, the first one, and I was going to win it. And then I had another good judge, the second one, and then they kept switching judges. And the third one was a bad judge. That\u2019s what happened. But, uh\u2026\nRYAN: But there\u2019s standards like malice is required. Would you weaken that? Would you require less than malice for news organizations?\nTRUMP: I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, yeah, I think I would get a little bit away from malice without having to get too totally away. Look, I think many of the stories about me are written badly. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s malice because the people don\u2019t know me. When Charles writes about me or when Ruth writes about me, you know, we\u2019ve never really met. And I get these stories and they\u2019re so angry and I actually say, I actually say, \u201cHow could they write?\u201d \u2013 and many stories I must tell you, many stories are written that with a brief phone call could be corrected before they\u2019re written. Nobody calls me.\nSTEPHEN STROMBERG, EDITORIAL WRITER: How are you defining \u201cincorrect?\u201d It seems like you\u2019re defining it as fairness or your view of fairness rather than accuracy.\nTRUMP: Fairness, fairness is, you know, part of the word. But you know, I\u2019ve had stories that are written that are absolutely incorrect. I\u2019ll tell you now and the word \u201cintent\u201d, as you know, is an important word, as you know, in libel. I\u2019ll give you an example. Some of the media, not all of it, but some of it, is very, very strong on \u2013 you know I get these massive crowds of people, and we\u2019ll get protesters. And these protesters are honestly, they\u2019re very bad people. In many cases, they\u2019re professionals. Highly trained professionals. And I will rent an arena for 20,000 seats and they will come in \u2013 because there\u2019s really no way \u2013 how you going to be able to tell \u2013 somebody said \u201coh you shouldn\u2019t let \u2018em in\u201d \u2013 how you gonna know, you know? They walk in. [Inaudible] So we had an incident this weekend, which was amazing in Tucson, Arizona where a man, a protestor, wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit, another one dragging an American flag, was walking out of the arena, and an African American man who was a supporter was sitting there listening to the speech and we had to stop because they were so loud \u2013 they\u2019re so loud, these people, I don\u2019t know what they do, they\u2019re trained voices or something. And they\u2019re walking up and you saw it, because it was all over television, and the African American man became incensed I think the guy said something to him like you know what, like \u201cscrew you,\u201d okay? Or worse. I think, because he looked over to him and said something to him and the guy just had it. Now, they were together, these two. The one wearing a Ku Klux Klan, the other dragging a flag or something, but the African American man, who I think was an Air Force person, I just read he had a pretty stellar life so far. And he just became incensed. So when I saw the television yesterday early in the morning I saw the Ku Klux Klan, I saw exactly what happened. By the time it got on to the national shows that was for the most part taken out. They just had this African American smacking, you know, fighting. And it didn\u2019t make sense, you know, why, why. But if you saw it in the morning it made a lot more sense. We don\u2019t condone violence at all but it\u2019s very, very unfair reporting and we, you know\u2026\nHIATT: Sorry, when you say we don\u2019t condone violence \u2014\nTRUMP: I say that.\nHIATT: You say that. But you\u2019ve also said, \u201cIn the good old days, he would have been ripped out of his seat so fast, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Isn\u2019t that condoning violence?\nTRUMP: No, because what I am referring to is, we\u2019ve had some very bad people come in. We had one guy \u2014 and I said it \u2014 he had the voice \u2014 and this was what I was referring to \u2014 and I said, \u201cBoy, I\u2019d like to smash him.\u201d You know, I said that. I\u2019d like to punch him. This guy was unbelievably loud. He had a voice like Pavarotti. I said if I was his manager I would have made a lot of money for him, because he had the best voice. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. And he was a swinger. He was hitting people. He was punching and swinging and screaming \u2014 you couldn\u2019t make \u2014 so you have to stop. You know, there is also something about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, \u201cscrew everybody.\u201d And that\u2019s when I made that statement. He was absolutely out \u2014 I mean, he hit people and he screamed and then he was walking out and he\u2019s giving everybody the finger. And they don\u2019t talk about that. See, they don\u2019t talk about that. They say, \u201cDonald, wait a second, Donald, don\u2019t\u201d \u2014\nHIATT: But your answer is you condone violence when the guy is really egregious and terrible?\nTRUMP: No, I condone strong law and order. I\u2019ll tell you what they \u2014\nHIATT: Rip him out of his seat, punch him in the face, isn\u2019t that violent?\nTRUMP: Well he punched other people.\nHIATT: No, I understand that.\nTRUMP: Fred, he punched other people. He was punching people. He was \u2014 one guy was, you know, I\u2019d like to say \u2014\nJO-ANN ARMAO, ASSOCIATE EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: The Fayetteville protester who was sucker punched \u2014 he didn\u2019t punch anyone \u2014\nTRUMP: No.\nARMAO: He was being escorted from police, and he was sucker punched.\nTRUMP: No. When are you talking about? When?\nARMAO: In Fayetteville.\nCOREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER [to Trump]: North Carolina.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know which one.\nARMAO: Yes you do.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. Because we\u2019ve had so many \u2014\nARMAO: That\u2019s the gentleman you said you were going to look into to see whether or not to pay his legal fees.\nTRUMP: Oh well that\u2019s a different \u2014 that\u2019s different from the one I\u2019m talking about. This one was about a month ago. This one was before Fayetteville.\nARMAO: Well, okay, Fayetteville, do you condone violence in that case \u2014\nTRUMP: No I don\u2019t, no I don\u2019t, that\u2019s different \u2014\nARMAO: Where the protester is being walked out \u2014\nTRUMP: By the way, that\u2019s different \u2014\nARMAO: But, yet, you explained it that he was giving the finger and so he provoked it, so he got sucker punched. And you are going to possibly pay for his legal expenses.\nTRUMP: He did give the finger, and \u2014\nARMAO: So that\u2019s okay?\nTRUMP: Well, a lot of people don\u2019t \u2014 you know, the finger means, \u201cF you.\u201d A lot of people think \u2014 and you have children there, you have a lot of children that go, you know, they go with their parents \u2014 a lot of people think that\u2019s very inappropriate. I mean, you know \u2014\nARMAO: It\u2019s certainly inappropriate.\nTRUMP: Well, I think it is.\nARMAO: But does it \u2014 is it \u2014 does it qualify to \u2014\nTRUMP: So do you let him \u2014\nARMAO: \u2014 to punch him in the face?\nTRUMP: Again I don\u2019t condone it. So do you let him walk out, he\u2019s holding up his finger, telling everybody. Same thing happened, you know, the last one in \u2014\nHIATT: I guess the question is, when you then offer to pay the guy\u2019s legal fees, isn\u2019t that \u2014\nTRUMP: I didn\u2019t offer \u2014\nHIATT: Isn\u2019t that condoning?\nTRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t offer, Fred \u2014\nHIATT: You said you would consider it \u2014\nTRUMP: I said I want to look into it. I said I want to look into it. I didn\u2019t say that.\nHIATT: Isn\u2019t that condoning?\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t think so.\nHIATT: Doesn\u2019t that convey a message of approval?\nTRUMP: Don\u2019t think so.\nLEWANDOWSKI: To be fair, before every event, there is a public service announcement made about \u2014\nTRUMP: It\u2019s true.\nLEWANDOWSKI: \u2014 any potential protesters. That is made to everybody that says \u2014\nTRUMP: Strong.\nLEWANDOWSKI: \u2014 please do not engage these protesters. You know, they may cause a disturbance. Please do your best, let local law enforcement handle this or security at that venue. The problem becomes, with a massive crowd of twenty or thirty or forty thousand people, the resources that are there don\u2019t have the ability to get to all these people in a manner before the crowd reacts, because the agitators are inciting those people. So we are very clear at the onset, that there is a loud public notice that says, \u201cplease do not engage these people, please let them do their job, and let the local law enforcement deal with that.\u201d That\u2019s said at the very front end at every event.\nTRUMP: Very loud, and it\u2019s repeated over and over. Actually, I guess it\u2019s on tape, but they repeat it over and over. One thing that was interesting this weekend. We had in Phoenix, Arizona, we had an interesting incident. We had people, we had a major highway coming into the arena. It\u2019s not an arena, it\u2019s a huge open space, 60 acres, and it was packed. And we had a major highway coming in, and people \u2014 protesters \u2014 stopped their car in the middle of the highway, chained themselves to their cars, and the cars \u2014 blocked. They were there for a while. A car was not able to move. They were backed up for 20 \u2014 I mean, like, just forever. And, it was terrible. And they were very abusive, screaming, you know, \u201cscrew you, screw you, pigs, pigs\u201d \u2014 meaning to the cops. Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 now that was his territory. Okay, he\u2019s a tough cookie. Sheriff Joe saw this, he gave them a couple of minutes to move their car \u2014 they didn\u2019t move them \u2014 cut the chains, arrested the people and just moved the cars over. I don\u2019t know how they did it \u2014 just, they were gone in minutes after he came there. Minutes. It was amazing how quick. They actually had chains around their necks. They didn\u2019t even know why they were there. People \u2013 somebody was interviewed, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d They didn\u2019t even know.\nNobody ever talks about these people. They say, \u201cOh, Trump had a bad rally,\u201d or something. You know there are two sides to it, and honestly, there is really one side of it \u2013 because you see how bad this was. So what happened is they arrested three people. There were probably a hundred or a hundred-fifty protesters, there were 21,000 people there, there were 150 protesters that were creating havoc. As soon as the three people were arrested, everybody else ran. That was the last we heard, and I made a speech for, you know, a half hour, 45 minutes \u2013 not one person stood up and started screaming at this speech. It was sort of an amazing thing.\nNow Tucson was different. Different police force, different level of, you know, whatever, and we had numerous interruptions during the speech. You know, I\u2019ll be speaking, I\u2019ll be ready to make a point, and a guy will stand up and start, just screaming. Out of \u2014 from nowhere, for, like, no reason. Not even screaming things that make sense, and often screaming tremendous obscenities.\nI know [Lewandowski] went in \u2013 he took a lot of heat a couple of days ago in that same rally because he went in to get \u2013 to quiet people down, and they had a couple of signs \u201cF-you\u201d \u2013 it just said \u201cF-you,\u201d meaning the word spelled out, and you have cameras there, you know, it\u2019s on live television, and you have guys holding signs saying \u201cF-you Trump\u201d or just \u201cF-you,\u201d and they had numerous of those \u2013 there were, you know, probably ten of those signs throughout the arena.\nAnd he went in to say, please would you move the sign, and the woman in front \u2013 and I saw it \u2013 this guy grabbed the woman in front, okay, he [Lewandowski] hardly touched him \u2013 he took him \u2013 If he touched him at all it was just grabbing the shirt a little bit. But the guy was a real wiseguy. And he was screaming obscenities. He did grab the woman in front and ultimately he was led out by the security guy, who was right behind him.\nBut the reason is that the police were slow to get there. And the point is this: You\u2019re making a speech and you have guys getting up saying, [ Editor\u2019s note: Trump says the next few words in a hushed voice ] \u201cfuck you,\u201d and the whole place goes, \u201cWhoa,\u201d and it incites the place. They incite the place, because then everyone goes, \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d That\u2019s why they\u2019re all screaming \u201cUSA, USA,\u201d or \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump.\u201d\nYou can have 20,000 people and you can have like two people. Usually \u2013 it\u2019s amazing \u2013 usually it\u2019s one person. I mean, it\u2019s like they stage it. It\u2019s very professional. They have like one person here, one person here, one person.\nOkay, we\u2019re talking about the media. So, I\u2019ve never seen the media cover it from that angle. It\u2019s always, \u201cTrump had a\u201d \u2014 and here\u2019s the big thing, I mean, honestly, essentially nobody has heard\nHIATT: But just \u2013 given the Supreme Court rulings on libel \u2014 Sullivan v. New York Times \u2014 how would you change the law?\nTRUMP: I would just loosen them up.\nRUTH MARCUS: What does that mean?\n[Crosstalk]\nTRUMP: I\u2019d have to get my lawyers in to tell you, but I would loosen them up. I would loosen them up. If The Washington Post writes badly about me \u2013 and they do, they don\u2019t write good \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t think I get \u2013 I read some of the stories coming up here, and I said to my staff, I said, \u201cWhy are we even wasting our time? The hatred is so enormous.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. I mean, I do a good job. I have thousands of employees. I work hard.\nI\u2019m not looking for bad for our country. I\u2019m a very rational person, I\u2019m a very sane person. I\u2019m not looking for bad. But I read articles by you, and others. And, you know, we\u2019ve never \u2013 we don\u2019t know each other, and the level of hatred is so incredible, I actually said, \u201cWhy am I \u2013 why am I doing this? Why am I even here?\u201d And I don\u2019t expect anything to happen\u2013\nRYAN: Would that be the standard then? If there is an article that you feel has hatred, or is bad, would that be the basis for libel?\nTRUMP: No, if it\u2019s wrong. If it\u2019s wrong.\nRYAN: Wrong whether there\u2019s malice or not?\nTRUMP: I mean, The Washington Post never calls me. I never had a call, \u201cWhy \u2013 why did you do this?\u201d or \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d It\u2019s just, you know, like I\u2019m this horrible human being. And I\u2019m not. You know, the one thing we have in common I think we all love the country. Now, maybe we come at it from different sides, but nobody ever calls me. I mean, Bob Costa calls about a political story \u2013 he called because we\u2019re meeting senators in a little while and congressmen, supporters \u2013 but nobody ever calls.\nRYAN: The reason I keep asking this is because you\u2019ve said three times you\u2019ve said we are going to open up the libel laws and when you ask you what you mean you say hatred, or bad\u2013\nTRUMP: I want to make it more fair from the side where I am, because things are said that are libelous, things are said about me that are so egregious and so wrong, and right now according to the libel laws I can do almost nothing about it because I\u2019m a well-known person you know, etc., etc.\nJACKSON DIEHL, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Back to foreign policy a little bit, can you talk a little bit about what you see as the future of NATO? Should it expand in any way?\nTRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have \u2013 I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they\u2019re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with \u2014 why are we always the one that\u2019s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I\u2019ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions\u2013 hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are.\nDIEHL: Hundreds of billions?\nTRUMP: Billions. Well if you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea \u2014 I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal. When you look at the kind of money that our country is losing, we can\u2019t afford to do this. Certainly we can\u2019t afford to do it anymore.\nDIEHL: About Ukraine, was it right for the United States to impose sanctions on Russia when they invaded Crimea and would you keep those sanctions on them?\nTRUMP: I think the answer is yes, it was, but I don\u2019t see other people doing much about it. I see us doing things about it, but I don\u2019t see other people doing much about it.\nDIEHL: And could I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30,000 troops and\u2014\nTRUMP: No I didn\u2019t, oh no no no, okay, I know what you\u2019re saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that 20- to 30,000. They said, would you send troops? I didn\u2019t say send 20,000. I said, well the generals are saying you\u2019d need because they , what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need 20- to 30,000 troops, but I didn\u2019t say that I would send them.\nDIEHL: If they said that, would you go along with that and send the troops?\nTRUMP: I find it hard to go along with\u2014I mention that as an example because it\u2019s so much. That\u2019s why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said did I say that and I said that that\u2019s a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and I\u2019d give them tremendous air supporters and support , because we have to get rid of ISIS, okay, just so \u2014 we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved.\nDIEHL: What about China and the South China Sea. What do you think they\u2019re up to and\u2014\nTRUMP: I think it\u2019s a terrible situation, I think it\u2019s terrible they have no respect for\u2013\nDIEHL: \u2013and what should we do about it?\nTRUMP: Well look, we have power over China and people don\u2019t realize it. We have trade power over China. I don\u2019t think we are going to start World War III over what they did, it affects other countries certainly a lot more than it affects us. But\u2014and honestly, you know part of\u2014I always say we have to be unpredictable. We\u2019re totally predictable. And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. I hate when they say \u2014 like I said get rid of the oil, keep the oil, different things over the years, when people are saying what would you do with regard to the Middle East, when we left \u2014 We should have never been in Iraq. It was a horr- it was one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. We then got out badly, then after we got out, I said, \u201cKeep the oil. If we don\u2019t keep it Iran\u2019s going to get it.\u201d And it turns out Iran and ISIS basically\u2014\nHIATT: How do you keep it without troops, how do you defend the oil?\nTRUMP: You would\u2026 You would, well for that\u2013 for that, I would circle it. I would defend those areas.\nHIATT: With U.S. troops?\nTRUMP: Yeah, I would defend the areas with the oil. And I would have taken out a lot of oil. And, uh, I would have kept it. I mean, I would have kept it, because, look: Iran has the oil, and they\u2019re going to have the oil, well, the stuff they don\u2019t have, because Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as you\u2019re sitting there. And I\u2019ve been very good on this stuff. My prognostications, my predictions have become, have been very accurate, if you look.\nHIATT: So what do you think China\u2019s aims are in the South China Sea?\nTRUMP: Well I know China very well, because I deal with China all the time. I\u2019ve done very well. China\u2019s unbelievably ambitious. China is, uh\u2026 I mean, when I deal with China, you know, I have the Bank of America building, I\u2019ve done some great deals with China. I do deals with them all the time on, you know, selling apartments, and, you know, people say \u2018oh that\u2019s not the same thing.\u2019 The level of\u2026 uh, the largest bank in the world, 400 million customers, is a tenant of mine in New York, in Manhattan. The biggest bank in China. The biggest bank in the world.\nChina has got unbelievable ambitions. China feels very invincible. We have rebuilt China. They have drained so much money out of our country that they\u2019ve rebuilt China. Without us, you wouldn\u2019t see the airports and the roadways and the bridges; I mean, the George Washington Bridge is like, that\u2019s like a trinket compared to the bridges that they\u2019ve built in China. We don\u2019t build anymore, and it, you know, we had our day. But China, if you look at what\u2019s going on in China, you know, they go down to seven percent or eight percent and it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. Our GDP is right now zero. Essentially zero.\nDIEHL: Could you use trade to cause them to retreat in the South China Sea?\nTRUMP: I think so, yeah. I think so\nDIEHL: What would you do?\nTRUMP: We, well, you start making it tougher. They\u2019re selling their products to us for\u2026 you know, with no tax, no nothing. By the way, we can\u2019t deal with them, but they can deal with us. See, we are free trade. The story is, and I have so many people that deal with China \u2013they can easily sell their product here. No tax, no nothing, just \u2018come on, bring it all in, you know, bring in your apples, bring in everything you make\u2019 and no taxes whatsoever, right? If you want to deal with China, it\u2019s just the opposite. You can\u2019t do that. In other words, if you want to, if you\u2019re a manufacturer, you want to go into China? It\u2019s very hard to get your product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax.\nHIATT: So, if they occupied what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, is that something the United States\u2026\nTRUMP: Well, I, you know, again, I don\u2019t like to tell you what I\u2019d do, because I don\u2019t want to\u2026 You understand what I\u2019m saying, Fred? If I\u2026 Okay, if I say \u2018Well, we should go in and do this or that or that,\u2019 I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to sort of\u2026 red flag all over it. I do think this: It\u2019s an unbelievable thing that they\u2019ve done, it\u2019s unbelievable aggression, it\u2019s unbelievable lack of respect for this country.\nHIATT: This theory of unpredictability, I want to push a little bit, I mean \u2013 there are many people who think that North Korea invaded South Korea precisely because Acheson wasn\u2019t clear that we would defend South Korea. So I\u2019m curious, does ambiguity sometimes have dangers?\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019ll give you, I\u2019ll give you an example. President Obama, when he left Iraq, gave a specific date \u2013 we\u2019re going to be out. I thought that was a terrible thing to do. And the enemy pulled back, because they don\u2019t want die. Despite what you read, you know, they don\u2019t want to die \u2014 and they just pulled back, and after we left, all hell broke out, right? And I\u2019ll give you another example that I think was terrible: when they sent, a few months ago, they sent fifty troops in. You know, fifty elite troops. Now, why do we have to have a news conference to announce that we\u2019re sending fifty troops? So those troops now have targets on their back. And\u2026you shouldn\u2019t do it. We\u2019re so predictable: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019re sending fifty troops into Iraq or Syria. And these are our elite troops. And they\u2019re going to do this and that and that and this.\u201d And those troops now are being hunted. If you didn\u2019t send them, they wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if you didn\u2019t say that, they wouldn\u2019t know. I mean, there are times when you just can\u2019t be\u2026 You talk too much. We talk too much. I guess they thought that was good politically, to say we\u2019re sending fifty troops? I don\u2019t think it was good.\nLANE: Can I ask you\u2026Just going back to NATO, because\u2026\nTRUMP: Yes.\nLANE: As you know, the whole theory of NATO from the beginning was to keep the United States involved in the long term in Europe to balance, to promote a balance of power in that region so we wouldn\u2019t have a repeat of World War I and World War 2. And it seems to be like what you\u2019re saying is very similar to what President Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg, in that we have allies that become free riders. So it seems like there\u2019s some convergence with the president there. What concerns me about both is that to some extent it was always thought to be in our interest that we, yes, we would take some of the burden on, yes, even if the net-net was not 100 percent, even steven, with the Germans. So I\u2019d like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries? Right, you\u2019ve painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense? Tell me more. Because it\u2019s not that you want to pull the U.S. out.\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We\u2019re not a rich country. We\u2019re borrowing, we\u2019re borrowing all of this money. We\u2019re borrowing money from China, which is a sort of an amazing situation. But things are a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we\u2019re protecting Europe but we\u2019re spending a lot of money. Number 1, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it. Obama has been stronger on the Ukraine than all the other countries put together, and those other countries right next door to the Ukraine. And I just say we have, I\u2019m not even knocking it, I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, we\u2019re not treated fair. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re treated fair, Charles, anywhere. If you look everything we have. You know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet we\u2019re not reimbursed fairly for what we do. We\u2019re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. We\u2019re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.\nLANE: You know, well, they say and I think this is on public record, it\u2019s basically 50 percent of the non-personnel cost is paid by South Korea and Japan.\nTRUMP: 50 percent?\nLANE: Yeah.\nTRUMP: Why isn\u2019t it 100 percent?\nHIATT: Well I guess the question is, does the United States gain anything by having bases?\nTRUMP: Personally I don\u2019t think so. I personally don\u2019t think so. Look. I have great relationships with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But that\u2019s a wealthy country. They make the ships, they make the televisions, they make the air conditioning. They make tremendous amounts of products. It\u2019s a huge, it\u2019s a massive industrial complex country. And \u2014\nHIATT: So you don\u2019t think the US gains from being the force that sort of that helps keep the peace in the Pacific?\nTRUMP: I think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we\u2019re a poor country now. We\u2019re a debtor nation. How you going to get rid \u2013 let me ask you \u2013 how are you going get rid of $21 trillion in debt? You\u2019re going to be at 21 trillion in a matter of minutes because of that new omnibus budget. So they passed that ridiculous omnibus budget. How you going to get rid of that debt. We\u2019re spending that to protect other countries. We\u2019re not spending it on ourselves. Because we have, we have armor-plated vehicles that are obsolete. The best ones are given to the enemy. We give them to our allies over in the Middle East. A bullet shot in the air and they immediately run and the enemy takes over. I have a friend whose son is in his third, his third tour over in Iraq. He\u2019s over in, I mean he\u2019s a very special kid, he\u2019s a great kid. But he\u2019s over in the Middle East, and, uh, Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East, actually. And he said to me, I said to him what do you think. And he said, it\u2019s so sad. He said the enemy has our equipment \u2013 the new version \u2014 and we have all the old version, and the enemy has our equipment, because they get into a fight with the so-called people like the Freedom Fighters, you know the whole Syrian deal, where we\u2019re sending billions and billions of dollars worth, and they capture the equipment. In most cases the shots are fired and everybody leaves. And these are the people we\u2019re backing. And we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be another Saddam Hussein deal, in other words, let\u2019s get rid of Assad with these people and these people end up being worse. Okay? But he said, they have better equipment. It\u2019s our equipment. They have, I guess we send 2,300 Humvees over, all armor-plated. So we have wounded warriors, with no legs, with no arms, because they were driving in stuff without the armor. And the enemy has most of the new ones we sent over that they captured. And he said, it\u2019s so discouraging when they see that the enemy has better equipment than we have \u2013 and it\u2019s our equipment.\nHIATT: I\u2019d like to come back to the campaign. You said a few weeks ago after a family in Chicago gave some money to a PAC opposing you, you said, \u201cThey better watch out. They have a lot to hide.\u201d What should they watch out for?\nTRUMP: Look, they are spending vicious \u2026 I don\u2019t even know these people. Those Ricketts. I actually said they ought to focus on the Chicago Cubs and, you know, stop playing around. They spent millions of dollars fighting me in Florida. And out of 68 counties, I won 66. I won by 20 points, almost 20 points. Against, everybody thought he was a popular sitting senator. I had $38 million dollars spent on me in Florida over a short period of time. $38 million. And, you know, the Ricketts, I don\u2019t even know these people.\nHIATT: So, what does it mean, \u201cThey better watch out\u201d?\nTRUMP: Well, it means that I\u2019ll start spending on them. I\u2019ll start taking ads telling them all what a rotten job they\u2019re doing with the Chicago Cubs. I mean, they are spending on me. I mean, so am I allowed to say that? I\u2019ll start doing ads about their baseball team. That it\u2019s not properly run or that they haven\u2019t done a good job in the brokerage business lately.\nRYAN: Would you do that while you are president?\nTRUMP: No, not while I am president. No, not while I\u2019m president. That is two phases. Right now, look, you know, I went to a great school, I was a good student and all. I am an intelligent person. My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at MIT for 35 years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else. Dr. John Trump, a great guy. I\u2019m an intelligent person. I understand what is going on. Right now, I had 17 people who started out. They are almost all gone. If I were going to do that in a different fashion I think I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. You would be interviewing somebody else. But it is hard to act presidential when you are being \u2026 I mean, actually I think it is presidential because it is winning. And winning is a pretty good thing for this country because we don\u2019t win any more. And I say it all the time. We do not win any more. This country doesn\u2019t win. We don\u2019t win with trade. We don\u2019t win with \u2026 We can\u2019t even beat ISIS. And by the way, just to answer the rest of that question, I would knock the hell out of ISIS in some form. I would rather not do it with our troops, you understand that. Very important. Because I think saying that is very important because I was against the war in Iraq, although they found a clip talking to Howard Stern, I said, \u201cWell\u2026\u201d It was very unenthusiastic. Before they want in, I was totally against the war. I was against it for years. I actually had a delegation sent from the White House to talk to me because I guess I get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I was just against the war. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it did. But we have to knock out ISIS. We are living like in medieval times. Who ever heard of the heads chopped off?\nHIATT: Just back to the campaign. You are smart and you went to a good school. Yet you are up there and talking about your hands and the size of private \u2026\nTRUMP: No \u2026\nHIATT: \u2026 your private parts.\nTRUMP: No, no. No, no. I am not doing that.\nHIATT: Do you regret having engaged in that?\nTRUMP: No, I had to do it. Look, this guy. Here\u2019s my hands. Now I have my hands, I hear, on the New Yorker, a picture of my hands.\nMARCUS: You\u2019re on the cover.\nTRUMP: A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They\u2019re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, \u201cOh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means.\u201d This was not me. This was Rubio that said, \u201cHe has small hands and you know what that means.\u201d Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later \u2026 and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, \u201cMr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands.\u201d And then another one would say, \u201cYou have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cI thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands.\u201d I had fifty people \u2026 Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, \u201cHow are Mr. Trump\u2019s hands?\u201d My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, \u201cOh, your hands are very nice. They are normal.\u201d So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say \u2026 now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn\u2019t work out. Obviously, it didn\u2019t work too well. But one of the things he said was \u201cHe has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else.\u201d You can look it up. I didn\u2019t say it.\nMARCUS: You chose to raise it \u2026\nTRUMP: No, I chose to respond.\nMARUS: You chose to respond.\nTRUMP: I had no choice.\nMARCUS: You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I\u2019m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me \u2026 every time I\u2019d shake people\u2019s hand, \u201cOh, you have nice hands.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions \u2026 I even held up my hands, and said, \u201cLook, take a look at that hand.\u201d\nMARCUS: You told us in the debate \u2026.\nTRUMP: And by saying that, I solved the problem. Nobody questions. Everyone held my hand. I said look. Take a look at that hand.\nMARCUS: You told us in the debate that you guaranteed there was not another problem. Was that presidential? And why did you decide to do that?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, \u2018Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the\u2013 a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can\u2019t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I\u2019ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think it\u2019s not a question of presidential \u2026\nMARCUS: He said he regrets \u2026\nHIATT: Okay, let\u2019s move on here. Let\u2019s move on.\nTRUMP: I did feel I should respond. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But I felt I should respond because everybody was talking about it.\nRYAN: You [MUFFLED] mentioned a few minutes earlier here that you would knock ISIS. You\u2019ve mentioned it many times. You\u2019ve also mentioned the risk of putting American troop in a danger area. If you could substantially reduce the risk of harm to ground troops, would you use a battlefield nuclear weapon to take out ISIS?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want to use, I don\u2019t want to start the process of nuclear. Remember the one thing that everybody has said, I\u2019m a counterpuncher. Rubio hit me. Bush hit me. When I said low energy, he\u2019s a low-energy individual, he hit me first. I spent, by the way he spent 18 million dollars\u2019 worth of negative ads on me. That\u2019s putting [MUFFLED]\u2026\nRYAN: This is about ISIS. You would not use a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS?\n[CROSSTALK]\nTRUMP: I\u2019ll tell you one thing, this is a very good looking group of people here. Could I just go around so I know who the hell I\u2019m talking to?\nHIATT: Sure, then I\u2019d like to let a couple of them get in questions.\nLEWANDOWSKI: We have got five minutes, hard out.\nHIATT: Okay.\nTRUMP: Oh is it?\nCORY: Yeah. You have a meeting you have to get to.\nTRUMP: Okay we do.\nARMAO: I\u2019m Jo-Ann Armao. I cover D.C. events. I want to ask you a question about what you think about D.C. voting rights or statehood.\nTRUMP: Okay. I\u2019ll talk about that.\nTOM TOLES, EDITORIAL CARTOONIST: Tom Toles.\nTRUMP: Hi, Tom.\nLANE: I\u2019m Charles \u2026\nTRUMP: Yes, I know Charles.\nSTROMBERG: Steve Stromberg, editorial writer.\nTRUMP: Right.\nMARCUS: Ruth Marcus.\nTRUMP: Right.\nRYAN: Fred Ryan.\nTRUMP: Right, right.\nDIEHL: Jackson Diehl.\nTRUMP: Good.\nJAMES DOWNIE: James Downie, digital opinions editor.\nTRUMP: Hi, James.\nMICHAEL LARABEE: Mike Larabee, I\u2019m the op-ed editor.\nTRUMP: Yes.\nCHRISTINE EMBA: Christine Emba.\nTRUMP: Hi, Christine.\nJAMIE RILEY: Jamie Riley, letters and local opinions.\nTRUMP: Good, yes, yes.\nKAREN ATTIAH: Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor.\nHIATT: Karen, you want to get a question in?\nATTIAH: Uh, yeah, I mean speaking again of the system of what a lot of people would say are some of the uglier components of your campaign; a lot of people have said you\u2019ve been running a very divisive campaign as far as racial divides, you\u2019ve noted you know your comments about Muslims, about Mexicans, immigrants and such. You have information that the country is becoming browner, is becoming younger, is becoming blacker. What in your vision of president, in your presidency, how would you bridge these divides and how will you address a\u2013 how are you going to run on a message of inclusion of all Americans?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, if you look at some polls that have come out, I\u2019m doing very well with African Americans. I\u2019m doing, actually if you look at the polls, a lot of the polls that came out, in the, um, what do they call it? Exit polls, like from Nevada and other places, I\u2019m doing very well with Hispanics.\nATTIAH: I think some of the polls are saying you\u2019re doing [in the] negatives.\nTRUMP: We do, if it\u2019s illegals, in other words, if it\u2019s everybody, but people that are legally living here, I\u2019m doing very well. In other words, people that are here, like Hispanics that are in the country, I\u2019m doing very well. People that vote. Like people leaving voting booths and all, I\u2019m doing very well with them. I want to be inclusive, but at the same time, people should come here legally. They should be here legally. And I think the reason I\u2019m doing, that I will do well, especially once I get started, don\u2019t forget I haven\u2019t even focused on Hillary yet. And, and as you know, you know I\u2019ve had polls that are against me, but I\u2019ve had many polls that say I\u2019d beat Hillary, but they\u2019re not that, that, they don\u2019t mean anything now because it\u2019s too early. Because I haven\u2019t hit her. I\u2019ve only hit her once, and that was eight weeks ago, but, I haven\u2019t started on Hillary yet, and when I do I think I\u2019ll be able to make my points. I mean, you know, but, but I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you.\nATTIAH: But do you feel that your messages, your rhetoric, are dangerous and divisive for this country? How do you feel they\u2019re \u2026.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t think so. No, I don\u2019t think so. With the Muslim thing I think it\u2019s a serious problem. I\u2019ve had Muslims call and tell me you\u2019re right with the Muslim thing, I think it\u2019s a serious problem. And it\u2019s a problem that has to be addressed. I mean, there\u2019s tremendous hatred. Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, and he\u2019s living right next to where he grew up. There\u2019s a serious, serious problem with the Muslims and it\u2019s got to be addressed. It\u2019s temporary, and it\u2019s got to be addressed. And you know you may think of it as negative. Many people think it\u2019s very positive.\nHIATT: How would you identify people to keep them out of this country?\nTRUMP: Well look, there\u2019s many exceptions. There\u2019s many \u2013 everything, you\u2019re going to go through a process. But we have to be very careful. And I was really referring in particular, you know, to migrations \u2013 Syrians, the whole migration, where we\u2019re going to take in thousands. And I heard in the Democrat debate, I heard 55,000, okay. 55,000. Now they say it\u2019s really ten [thousand], but it\u2019s already 10, and I just don\u2019t think we can take people into this country. You saw what two people did \u2013 the woman and the man, whether she radicalized him or [inaudible] \u2013 but you saw what two people did, and I just don\u2019t think we can take people in when we have no idea who they are, where they come from. There\u2019s no documents, there\u2019s no paper, and we have ISIS looming over our head, and we have tremendous destruction. We lost the World Trade Center, we lost the Pentag \u2013 you know, we had a plane go into the Pentagon, etc.\nARMAO: D.C.: You told Chuck Todd last year on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that you love D.C., you love the people, that you want to do what\u2019s best for them. They think what\u2019s best for them is statehood or at the very least voting rights. What is your position on those two things?\nTRUMP: I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C. I think it\u2019s a tough thing. I don\u2019t have a position on it yet. I would form a position. But I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C.\nARMAO: Tough politically?\nTRUMP: I think it\u2019s just something that I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be inclined to do. I\u2019d like to study it. It\u2019s not a question really \u2013 maybe Chuck didn\u2019t ask me like you\u2019re asking me \u2013 I don\u2019t see statehood for D.C.\nARMAO: What about having a vote in the House of Representatives?\nTRUMP: I think that\u2019s something that would be okay. Having representation would be okay.\nHIATT: Last one: You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change?\nTRUMP: I think there\u2019s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. I\u2019m not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes \u2013 if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they don\u2019t know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now they\u2019re using \u201cextreme weather\u201d I guess more than any other phrase. I am not \u2013 I know it hurts me with this room, and I know it\u2019s probably a killer with this room \u2013 but I am not a believer. Perhaps there\u2019s a minor effect, but I\u2019m not a big believer in man-made climate change.\nSTROMBERG: Don\u2019t good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them?\nTRUMP: Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think we\u2019re in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me \u2013 I know President Obama thought it was climate change \u2013 to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. That\u2019s \u2013 that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we don\u2019t even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We don\u2019t know who has them. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons.\nRYAN: Thank you for joining us.",

Let's keep the momentum up on state legislators - share the petition on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1ovwWBb Update #1 about a month ago \nSome bad news: a group of all-male legislators in Utah have voted to keep the state's tax on tampons and other feminine hygiene products. Please share the petition on Facebook to keep up the pressure up on legislators in other states: http://on.fb.me/1ovwWBb About This Petition Periods are not a luxury, yet 40 U.S. states currently tax feminine hygiene products. Forty-five states allow tax exemptions for \"necessities\" like groceries, live circus performances (!), even candy (!!), but tampons are largely considered \u201cluxury\u201d or nonessential items, and are therefore subject to taxation.While there is no conspiracy in which state tax laws specifically target tampons (rather, it is a sales tax that applies to tampons - in many states, toilet paper and incontinence pads are also affected by these sales taxes), it's absolutely unfair that a product we need to manage a basic and regular bodily function is subject to burdensome taxation. A meager 5 states do not charge a state-level sales tax for tampons. Five others \u2014Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania \u2014 have specifically exempted feminine hygiene products from sales taxes. California , Utah and Virginia have introduced bills that would create exemptions for taxes on pads and tampons. Canada ended its tampon tax in July 2015. The rest of the U.S. needs to follow.

Bernie Sanders speaks at a campaign rally at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, March 15, 2016. 0 Shares Email Bernie Sanders , the only Jewish presidential candidate this election cycle, was also the only candidate who elected not to attend the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) meeting this year. While all other candidates, including the remaining three Republicans and Hillary Clinton , spoke to the group in Washington, D.C ., today, Sanders instead took time while campaigning in Utah to deliver his own foreign policy speech, during which he had very pointed criticism for the Israeli government. During his remarks, which he described as the speech he would have given had he chosen to attend the powerful political lobby\u2019s event today, the senator called the U.S. and Israel long-term friends but said that because of that special relationship they were \u201cobligated to speak the truth\u201d to each other. Sanders Says He Would Ask Obama to Withdraw SCOTUS Nomination if Elected President \u201cThat is what real friendship demands, especially in difficult times. Our disagreements will come and go, and we must weather them constructively,\u201d he said. Sanders reminded the crowd of reporters and activists that he spent time living in Israel and working on a kibbutz, and argued that because of that he was \u201cprobably the only candidate\u201d with \u201cpersonal ties\u201d to the country. He specifically called it \u201cabsurd\u201d that a portion of Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019s government suggested increased settlements in the West Bank and added that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that they had withheld tax revenue from Palestinians. He talked about water and economic rights for Palestinians and said ending the economic blockade of Gaza would also be necessary for sustainable peace. \"I will work tirelessly to advance the cause of peace as a partner and as a friend to Israel. But to be successful, we have also have got to be a friend not only to Israel, but to the Palestinian people,\u201d he continued. The senator spoke at length about the need for Israel to end \u201cdisproportionate\u201d responses to being attacked. He talked specifically about the escalated violence in 2014. He strongly objected to Hamas' positions against Israel and condemned the group\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate rocket fire\u201d into Israeli territory, but then he pivoted to Israel\u2019s actions as well. \u201cLet me also be very clear: I -- along with many supporters of Israel \u2013 spoke out strongly against the Israeli counterattacks that killed nearly 1,500 civilians and wounded thousands more. I condemned the bombing of hospitals, schools and refugee camps. Today, Gaza is still largely in ruins. The international community must come together to help Gaza recover,\u201d he added. Sanders has consistently been a strong advocate for a two-state solution in the region, but so far has shied away from details on the topic on the campaign trail. His speech was especially noteworthy given the much more forceful defense of Israel lodged by Clinton, his primary opponent, today. 0 Shares",

      "text": "Twitter By Anthony Savignano. Unfortunately for Donald and Ivana Trump, all that glittered wasn\u2019t gold. But the reign of New York\u2019s self-created imperial couple isn\u2019t over yet. Donald\u2019s Midas touch may be tarnished, but the banks are still throwing money at him, while Ivana is busy brokering a future of her own. Marie Brenner reports on how the Trumps are still going for it all. by Marie Brenner \n\u2018We have an old custom here at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Donald Trump was saying one night at dinner in his 118-room winter palace in Palm Beach. \u201cOur custom is to go around the table after dinner and introduce ourselves to each other.\u201d Trump had seemed fidgety that night, understandably eager to move the dinner party along so that he could go to bed. \n\u201cOld custom? He\u2019s only had Mrs. Post\u2019s house a few months. Really! I\u2019m going home,\u201d one Palm Beach resident whispered to his date. \n\u201cOh, stay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be so amusing.\u201d \nIt was spring, four years ago. Donald and Ivana Trump were seated at opposite ends of their long Sheraton table in Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post\u2019s former dining room. They were posed in imperial style, as if they were a king and queen. They were at the height of their ride, and it was plenty glorious. Trump was seen on the news shows offering his services to negotiate with the Russians. There was talk that he might make a run for president. Ivana had had so much publicity that she now offered interviewers a press kit of flattering clips. Anything seemed possible, the Trumps had grown to such stature in the golden city of New York. \nIt was balmy that night in Palm Beach; Ivana wore a strapless dress. The air was redolent with the fragrance of oleander and bougainvillea, mingled with the slight smell of mildew which clung to the old house. To his credit, Trump had no interest in mastering the Palm Beach style of navy blazers and linen trousers. Often he wore a business suit to his table; his only concession to local custom was to wear a pink tie or pale shoes. To her credit, Ivana still served the dinners her husband preferred, so on that warm night the guests ate beef with potatoes. Mrs. Post\u2019s faux-Tiepolo ceiling remained in the dining room, but an immense silver bowl now rested in the center of the table, filled with plastic fruit. As always, it was business with the Trumps, for that was their common purpose, the bond between them. In recent years, they never seemed to touch each other or exchange intimate remarks in public. They had become less like man and wife and more like two ambassadors from different countries, each with a separate agenda. \nThe Trumps had bought Mar-a-Lago only a few months earlier, but already they had become Palm Beach curiosities. Across the road was the Bath and Tennis Club, \u201cthe B and T,\u201d as the locals called it, and it was said that the Trumps had yet to be invited to join. \u201cUtter bullshit! They kiss my ass in Palm Beach,\u201d Trump told me recently. \u201cThose phonies! That club called me and asked me if they could have my consent to use part of my beach to expand the space for their cabanas! I said, \u2018Of course!\u2019 Do you think if I wanted to be a member they would have turned me down? I wouldn\u2019t join that club, because they don\u2019t take blacks and Jews.\u201d \nAs if Mar-a-Lago and the Trump Princess yacht were James Gatz\u2019s West Egg estate, invitations were much prized, for the local snobs loved to dine out on tales of the Trumps. And now this! Embarrassing their guests by having them make speeches, as if they were at a sales convention! \nWhen it was Ivana\u2019s turn to introduce herself that night, she rose quickly. \u201cI am married to the most wonderful husband. He is so generous and smart. We are so lucky to have this life.\u201d She was desperately playing to him, but Donald said nothing in return. He seemed tired of hearing Ivana\u2019s endless praise; her subservient quality appeared to be getting to him. Perhaps he was spoiling for something to excite him, like a fight. Maybe all the public posturing was beginning to get boring, too. \u201cWell, I\u2019m done,\u201d he said before dessert, tossing his napkin on the table and vanishing from the room. \nPalm Beach had been Ivana Trump\u2019s idea. Long ago, Donald had screamed at her, \u201cI want nothing social that you aspire to. If that is what makes you happy, get another husband!\u201d But she had no intention of doing that, for Ivana, like Donald, was living out a fantasy. She had seen that in the Trump life everything and everybody appeared to come with a price, or a marker for future use. Ivana had learned to look through Donald with glazed eyes when he said to close friends, as he had in the early years of their marriage, \u201cI would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?\u201d She had gotten out of Eastern Europe by being tough and highly disciplined, and she had compounded her skills through her husband, the master manipulator. She had learned the lingua franca in a world where everyone seemed to be using everyone else in a relentless drive for power. How was she to know that there was another way to live? Besides, she often told her friends, however cruel Donald could be, she was very much in love with him. \nThis night Ivana had managed to wedge in the publisher of the local social paper, \u201cthe Shiny Sheet.\u201d As usual, Donald\u2019s weekend guests were paybacks, for he trusted few people. He had invited one of his construction executives, the mayor of West Palm Beach, and the former governor of New York, Hugh Carey, who in his days running the state as \u201cSociety Carey,\u201d boosted by huge Trump donations, had been crucial to Trump\u2019s early success. \nFor years, Ivana appeared to have studied the public behavior of the royals. Her friends now called this \u201cIvana\u2019s imperial-couple syndrome,\u201d and they teased her about it, for they knew that Ivana, like Donald, was inventing and reinventing herself all the time. When she had first come to New York, she wore elaborate helmet hairdos and bouffant satin dresses, very Hollywood; her image of rich American women probably came from the movies she had seen as a child. Ivana had now spent years passing through the fine rooms of New York, but she had never seemed to learn the real way of the truly rich, the art of understatement. Instead, she had become regal, filling her houses with the kind of ormolu found in palaces in Eastern Europe. She had taken to waving to friends with tiny hand motions, as if to conserve her energy. At her own charity receptions, she insisted that she and Donald form a receiving line, and she would stand in pinpoint heels, never sinking into the deep grass\u2014such was her control. \nThis spring night, a squad of servants had been outside to greet the guests, as if they had arrived at Cliveden between the wars. Most of the staff, however, were not a permanent part of Mar-a-Lago; they were local caterers and car parks, hired for the evening. In addition to the dining-room ceiling, Ivana had left Mrs. Post\u2019s shabby fringed sofas and Moroccan suites totally in place, giving the impression that she was trying on Mrs. Post\u2019s persona too. One of the few signs of the new owners\u2019 taste was the dozens of silver frames on the many end tables. The frames did not contain family pictures, but magazine covers. Each cover featured the face of Donald Trump. \nWhen the Trump plane landed in Palm Beach, two cars were usually waiting, the first a Rolls-Royce for the adults, the second a station wagon for the children, the nannies, and a bodyguard. Occasionally, state troopers were on hand to speed the Trump motorcade along. This took a certain amount of planning and coordination, but the effort was crucial for what Ivana was trying to achieve. \u201cIn fifty years Donald and I will be considered old money like the Vanderbilts,\u201d she once told the writer Dominick Dunne. \nThis past April, when his empire was in danger of collapse, Trump isolated himself in a small apartment on a lower floor of Trump Tower. He would lie on his bed, staring at the ceiling, talking into the night on the telephone. The Trumps had separated. Ivana remained upstairs in the family triplex with its beige onyx floors and low-ceilinged living room painted with murals in the style of Michelangelo. The murals had occasioned one of their frequent fights: Ivana wanted cherubs, Donald preferred warriors. The warriors won. \u201cIf this were on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, it would be very much in place in terms of quality,\u201d Trump once said of the work. That April, Ivana began to tell her friends that she was worried about Donald\u2019s state of mind. \nShe had been completely humiliated by Donald through his public association with Marla Maples. \u201cHow can you say you love us? You don\u2019t love us! You don\u2019t even love yourself. You just love your money,\u201d twelve-year-old Donald junior told his father, according to friends of Ivana\u2019s. \u201cWhat kind of son have I created?\u201d Trump\u2019s mother, Mary, is said to have asked Ivana. \nHowever unlikely it seemed, Ivana was now considered a tabloid heroine, and her popularity seemed in inverse proportion to the fickle city\u2019s new dislike of her husband. \u201cIvana is now a media goddess on par with Princess Di, Madonna, and Elizabeth Taylor,\u201d Liz Smith reported. Months earlier, Ivana had undergone cosmetic reconstruction with a California doctor. She emerged unrecognizable to her friends and perhaps her children, as fresh and innocent of face as Heidi of Edelweiss Farms. Although she had negotiated four separate marital-property agreements over the last fourteen years, she was suing her husband for half his assets. Trump was trying to be philosophical. \u201cWhen a man leaves a woman, especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of ass\u2014a good one!\u2014there are 50 percent of the population who will love the woman who was left,\u201d he told me. \nIvana had hired a public-relations man to help her in her new role. \u201cThis is all very calculated,\u201d one of her advisers told me. \u201cIvana is very shrewd. She\u2019s playing it to the hilt.\u201d \nMany floors beneath the Trumps, Japanese tourists roamed the Trump Tower lobby with their cameras. Inevitably, they took pictures of the display of Trump\u2019s familiar portrait from the cover of his book Trump: The Art of the Deal , which was propped on an easel outside the Trump Tower real-estate office. The Japanese still took Donald Trump to be the very image of power and money, and seemed to believe, as Trump once had, that this red-marble-and-brass monument was the center of the world. \nFor days, Trump rarely left his building. Hamburgers and French fries were sent up to him from the nearby New York Delicatessen. His body ballooned, his hair curled down his neck. \u201cYou remind me of Howard Hughes,\u201d a friend told him. \u201cThanks,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cI admire him.\u201d On the telephone he sounded ebullient, without a care, as confident as the image he projected in his lobby portrait. \nLike John Connally, the former governor of Texas, Trump had millions of dollars signed away in personal guarantees. The personal debt on the Trump Shuttle alone was $135 million. Bear Stearns had been guaranteed $56 million for Trump\u2019s Alexander\u2019s and American Airlines positions. The Taj Mahal casino had a complicated set of provisions which made Trump responsible for $35 million. Trump had personally guaranteed $125 million for the Plaza hotel. In West Palm Beach, Trump Plaza was so empty it was nicknamed \u201cthe Trump See-Through.\u201d That building alone carried $14 million worth of personal debt. Trump\u2019s mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach, as well as the yacht, had been promised to the banks for $40 million in outstanding loans. The Wall Street Journal estimated that Trump\u2019s guarantees could exceed $600 million. In one astonishing decade, Donald Trump had become the Brazil of Manhattan. \n\u2018Anybody who is anybody sits between the columns. The food is the worst, but you\u2019ll see everybody here,\u201d Donald Trump told me ten years ago at the \u201c21\u201d Club. Donald had already cut a swath in this preserve of the New York establishment; we were immediately seated between the columns in the old upstairs room, then decorated with black paneling and red Naugahyde banquettes. It was the autumn of 1980, a fine season in New York. The Yankees were in the pennant race; a movie star was running for president and using the term \u201cderegulation\u201d in his campaign. Donald was new then, thirty-four years old and very brash, just beginning to make copy and loving it. He was already fodder for the dailies and the weeklies, but he was desperate for national attention. \u201cDid you see that The New York Times said I looked like Robert Redford?\u201d he asked me. \nTrump hasn\u2019t changed much physically in the last ten years. Then, as now, he was all cheeks and jaw, with a tendency to look soft in the middle. He retains the blond hair, youthful swagger, and elastic face that give him the quality of the cartoon tough Baby Huey. Trump is a head swiveler, always looking around to see who else is in the room. As a boy, he was equally restless. \u201cDonald was the child who would throw the cake at the birthday parties,\u201d his brother Robert once told me. \u201cIf I built the bricks up, Donald would come along and glue them all together, and that would be the end of my bricks.\u201d \nHe was already married to Ivana, a former model and athlete from Czechoslovakia. One night in 1976, Trump had been at the bar in Maxwell\u2019s Plum. Maxwell\u2019s Plum is gone now, but the very name evokes the era of frantic singles underneath the Art Nouveau ceiling. It was the place where flight attendants hoped to find bankers, and models looked for dates. Donald met his model, Ivana Zelnickova, visiting from Montreal. She liked to tell the story of how she had gone skiing with Donald, pretending to be a learner like him, and then humiliated him by whizzing past him down the slopes. \nThey were married in New York during Easter of 1977. Mayor Beame attended the wedding at Marble Collegiate Church. Donald had already made his alliance with Roy Cohn, who would become his lawyer and mentor. Shortly before the wedding, Donald reportedly told Ivana, \u201cYou have to sign this agreement.\u201d \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust a document that will protect my family money.\u201d Cohn gallantly offered to find Ivana a lawyer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have these documents in Czechoslovakia,\u201d Ivana reportedly said, but she told friends that she was terrified of Cohn and his power over Donald. The first agreement gave Ivana $20,000 a year. Two years later, Trump had made his own fortune. \u201cYou better redo the agreement, Donald,\u201d Cohn reportedly told him. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re going to look hard and greedy.\u201d Ivana resisted. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, stick to the old agreement,\u201d Trump is said to have replied. \nDonald was determined to have a large family. \u201cI want five children, like in my own family, because with five, then I will know that one will be guaranteed to turn out like me,\u201d Donald told a close friend. He was willing to be generous with Ivana, and a story went around that he was giving her a cash bonus of $250,000 for each child. \nThe Trumps and their baby, Donald junior, lived in a Fifth Avenue apartment decorated with beige velvet sectional sofas and a bone-and-goatskin table from the Italian furniture store Casa Bella. They had a collection of Steuben glass animals which they displayed on glass shelves in the front hall. The shelves were outlined with a string of tiny white lights usually seen on a Christmas tree. \nDonald was trying to make time in the world of aesthetes and little black cocktail dresses. He had just completed the Grand Hyatt, on East Forty-second Street, and was considered a comer. He had put together the Fifth Avenue parcel that would become Trump Tower and had enraged the city establishment with his demolition of the cherished Art Deco friezes that had decorated the Bonwit Teller building. Even then, Trump\u2019s style was to turn on his audience. \n\u201cWhat do you think? Do you think blowing up the sculptures has hurt me?\u201d he asked me that day at \u201c21.\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cWho cares?\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s say that I had given that junk to the Met. They would have just put them in their basement. I\u2019ll never have the goodwill of the Establishment, the tastemakers of New York. Do you think, if I failed, these guys in New York would be unhappy? They would be thrilled! Because they have never tried anything on the scale that I am trying things in this city. I don\u2019t care about their goodwill.\u201d \nDonald was like an overgrown kid, all rough edges and inflated ego. He had brought the broad style of Brooklyn and Queens into Manhattan, flouting what he considered effete conventions, such as landmark preservation. His suits were badly cut, with wide cuffs on his trousers; he was a shade away from cigars. \u201cI don\u2019t put on any airs,\u201d he told me. He tooled around New York in a silver Cadillac with \u201cDJT\u201d plates and tinted windows and had a former city cop for his driver. \nDonald and I were not alone at lunch that day. He had invited Stanley Friedman to join us. Friedman was a partner of Roy Cohn\u2019s and, like Cohn, a legend in the city. He was part of the Bronx political machine, and would soon be appointed the Bronx County leader. Later, Friedman would go to jail for his role in the city parking-meter scandal. Trump and Friedman spent most of our lunch swapping stories about Roy Cohn. \u201cRoy could fix anyone in the city,\u201d Friedman told me. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a lousy lawyer, but he\u2019s a genius,\u201d Trump said. \nAt one point, Preston Robert Tisch, known to all as Bob, came into the upstairs room at \u201c21.\u201d Bob Tisch and his brother, Laurence, now the head of CBS, had made their fortune in New York and Florida real estate and hotels. Bob Tisch, like his brother, was a city booster, a man of goodwill and manners, a benefactor of hospitals and universities. \n\u201cI beat Bob Tisch on the convention-center site,\u201d Donald said loudly when Tisch stopped by our table. \u201cBut we\u2019re friends now, good friends, isn\u2019t that right, Bob? Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d \nBob Tisch\u2019s smile remained on his face, but there was a sudden strain in his tone, as if a child had misbehaved. \u201cOh yes, Donald,\u201d he said, \u201cgood friends. Very good friends.\u201d \nLate on summer Friday afternoons, the city of noise takes on an eerie quiet. In June I was with one of Donald Trump\u2019s more combative lawyers. \u201cWe certainly won\u2019t win in the popular press,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut we will win. You\u2019ll see.\u201d I thought of Trump a few blocks away, isolated in Trump Tower, fighting for his financial life. \nThe phone rang several times. \u201cYeah, yeah? Is that so?\u201d the lawyer said, and then laughed at the sheer\u2014as he phrased it\u2014\u201cbrass balls\u201d of his client, standing up to the numbers guys who were representing Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust, whom he was into for hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cDonald\u2019s very up. This is the kind of challenge Donald likes,\u201d the lawyer told me. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. You would never know anything is wrong.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t believe anything you read in the papers,\u201d Trump had told his publisher Joni Evans. \u201cWhen they hear the good news about me, what are they going to do?\u201d Random House was rushing to publish his new book, Trump: Surviving at the Top , with a first printing of 500,000. \nIn the Trump Tower conference room that week, one lawyer had reportedly told Trump the obvious: the Plaza hotel might never bring the $400 million he had paid for it. Trump stayed cool. \u201cGet me the Sultan of Brunei on the telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a personal guarantee that the Sultan of Brunei will take me out of the Plaza at an immense profit.\u201d \nThe bankers and lawyers in the conference room looked at Trump with a combination of awe and disbelief. Whatever their cynical instincts, Trump, the Music Man of real estate, could set off in them the power of imagination, for his real skill has always been his ability to convince others of his possibilities. The line between a con man and an entrepreneur is often fuzzy. \u201cThey say the Plaza is worth $400 million? Trump says it\u2019s worth $800 million. Who the hell knows what it is worth? I can tell you one thing: it is worth a lot more than I paid for it,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cWhen Forbes puts low values on all my properties, they say I am only worth $500 million! Well, that\u2019s $500 million more than I started with.\u201d \n\u2018Do people really think I am in trouble?\u201d Trump asked me recently. \n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cthey think you\u2019re finished.\u201d \nIt was an afternoon in July, when the dust seemed to be settling, and we were in the middle of a two-hour phone conversation. The conversation itself was a negotiation. Trump attempted to put me on the defensive. I had written about him ten years before. Trump had talked about a close friend of his who was the son of a famous New York real-estate developer. \u201cI told him to get out from under his father\u2019s thumb,\u201d Trump told me then. \u201cThat was off the record,\u201d Trump told me now. I looked up my old notes. \u201cWrong, Donald,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat was off the record was when you attacked your other friend and said he was an alcoholic.\u201d Without missing a beat, Trump said, \u201cI believe you.\u201d Then Trump laughed. \u201cSome things never change.\u201d \n\u201cJust wait five years,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cThis is really a no-brainer. Just like the Merv Griffin deal. When I took him to the cleaners, the press wanted me to lose. They said, \u2018Holy shit! Trump got taken!\u2019 Let me tell you something. It\u2019s good for me to be thought of as poor right now. You wouldn\u2019t believe some of the deals I am making! I guess I have a perverse personality. . . . I\u2019ve really enjoyed the last few weeks,\u201d he said, as if he had been rejuvenated at a spa. \nDeals had always been his only art. He was reportedly getting unbelievable deals now from the contractors he had hired to build his casinos and the fiberglass elephants that decorate the Boardwalk in front of the Taj Mahal, for they were desperate, unsure that they would ever get paid for months of work. Trump was famous for his skill at squeezing every last bit out of his transactions. He was known to be making shocking deals now that he never could have made two months before. \u201cTrump won\u2019t do a deal unless there\u2019s something extra\u2014a kind of moral larceny\u2014in it,\u201d one of his rivals once said of him. \u201cThings had gotten too easy for me,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI made a lot of money and I made it too easily, to the point of boredom. Anything I did worked! I took on Bally, I made $32 million. After a while it was too easy.\u201d \nThe fear of boredom has always loomed large in Trump\u2019s life. He has a short attention span. He even gave the appearance of having grown bored with his wife. He told me he had grown weary of his deals, his companies, \u201cNew York phonies,\u201d \u201cPalm Beach phonies,\u201d most social people, \u201cnegative\u201d writers, and \u201cnegatives\u201d in general. \u201cYou keep hitting and hitting and hitting, and after a while it doesn\u2019t mean as much to you,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cHey, when you first knew me, I basically had done nothing! So I had built a building or two, big deal.\u201d \nThat morning, Trump had been yet again on the front page of the New York Daily News , because Forbes had dropped him off the list of the world\u2019s richest men, placing his net worth at $500 million, down from $1.7 billion in 1989. \u201cThey put me on the front page for this bullshit reason!\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they put me on the cover of the Daily News , they sell more papers! They put me on the cover of the Daily News today with wars breaking out! You know why? Malcolm Forbes got thrown out of the Plaza by me! You know the story about me and Malcolm Forbes, when I kicked him out of the Plaza hotel? No? Well, I did. You\u2019ll read all about it in my new book. And I didn\u2019t throw him out because he didn\u2019t pay his bill. So I\u2019ve been expecting this attack from Forbes. The same writer who wrote about this also wrote that Merv kicked my ass! The same writer is under investigation. You heard about that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d (A Forbes writer is under investigation\u2014for alleged use of outdated police credentials. He did not write that Trump was taken by Merv Griffin.) \u201cWhat happened to me is what is happening in every company in America right now. There is not a company in America that isn\u2019t restructuring! Didn\u2019t you see The Wall Street Journal this morning about Revlon? What is going on at Revlon is what has happened to Donald Trump. But no one makes Revlon a front-page story. My problems didn\u2019t even merit a column in The Wall Street Journal. \u201d (Revlon was selling $182 million worth of stock to raise cash, but that was hardly the same as Trump\u2019s crisis.) \nTrump spoke in a hypnotic, unending torrent of words. Often he appeared to free-associate. He referred to himself in the third person: \u201cTrump says. . . Trump believes.\u201d His phrases skibbled around and doubled back on themselves like fireworks in a summer sky. He reminded me of a carnival barker trying to fill his tent. \u201cI\u2019m more popular now than I was two months ago. There are two publics as far as I\u2019m concerned. The real public and then there\u2019s the New York society horseshit. The real public has always liked Donald Trump. The real public feels that Donald Trump is going through Trump-bashing. When I go out now, forget about it. I\u2019m mobbed. It\u2019s bedlam,\u201d Trump told me. \nTrump is often belligerent, as if to pep things up. On the telephone with me, he attacked a local writer as \u201ca disgrace\u201d and savaged a financier\u2019s wife I knew as \u201ca giant, a three in the looks department.\u201d After the Resorts International deal, at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at the Aspen home of Barbara Walters and Merv Adelson, Trump was asked to make a wish for the coming year. \u201cI wish I had another Merv Griffin to bat around,\u201d he said. \nBefore the opening of the Taj Mahal, Marvin Roffman, a financial analyst from Philadelphia, correctly stated that the Taj was in for a rough ride. For that, Roffman believes, Trump had him fired. \u201cIs that why you attacked him?\u201d I asked Trump. \u201cI\u2019d do it again. Here\u2019s a guy that used to call me, begging me to buy stock through him, with the implication that if I\u2019d buy stock he\u2019d give me positive comments.\u201d \u201cAre you accusing him of fraud?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019m accusing him of being not very good at what he does.\u201d Congressman John Dingell of Michigan asked the S.E.C. to investigate the circumstances of Roffman\u2019s firing. When I asked Roffman about Trump\u2019s charges he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the most unbelievable garbage I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life.\u201d Roffman\u2019s attorney James Schwartzman called Trump\u2019s allegations \u201cthe desperate act of a desperate man.\u201d Roffman is now suing Trump for defamation of character. \n\u201cDonald is a believer in the big-lie theory,\u201d his lawyer had told me. \u201cIf you say something again and again, people will believe you.\u201d \n\u201cOne of my lawyers said that?\u201d Trump said when I asked him about it. \u201cI think if one of my lawyers said that, I\u2019d like to know who it is, because I\u2019d fire his ass. I\u2019d like to find out who the scumbag is!\u201d \nOne of Trump\u2019s first major deals in New York was to acquire a large tract of land on West Thirty-fourth Street being offered by the bankrupt Penn Central railroad. Trump submitted a plan for a convention center to city officials. \u201cHe told us he\u2019d forgo his $4.4 million fee if we would name the new convention center after his father,\u201d former deputy mayor Peter Solomon said. \u201cSomeone finally read the contract. He wasn\u2019t entitled to anywhere near the money he was claiming. It was unbelievable. He almost got us to name the convention center after his father in return for something he never really had to give away.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s first major real-estate coup in New York was the acquisition of the Commodore Hotel, which would become the Grand Hyatt. This deal, secured with a controversial tax abatement from the city, made Trump\u2019s reputation. His partner at the time was the well-respected Pritzker family of Chicago, who owned the Hyatt chain. Their contract was specific: Trump and Jay Pritzker agreed that if there were any sticking points they would have a ten-day period to arbitrate their differences. At one point, they had a minor disagreement. \u201cJay Pritzker was leaving for a trip to Nepal, where he was to be incommunicado,\u201d a lawyer for the Pritzker family told me. \u201cDonald waited until Jay was in the airplane before he called him. Naturally, Jay couldn\u2019t call him back. He was on a mountain in Nepal. Later, Donald kept saying, \u2018I tried to call you. I gave you the ten days. But you were in Nepal.\u2019 It was outrageous. Pritzker was his partner, not his enemy! This is how he acted on his first important deal.\u201d Trump later even reported the incident in his book. \n\u201cGive them the old Trump bullshit,\u201d he told the architect Der Scutt before a presentation of the Trump Tower design at a press conference in 1980. \u201cTell them it is going to be a million square feet, sixty-eight stories.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t lie, Donald,\u201d the architect replied. \nEventually Trump bought out the Equitable Life Assurance company\u2019s share of the commercial space in Trump Tower. \u201cHe paid Equitable $60 million after an arm\u2019s-length negotiation,\u201d a top real-estate developer told me. \u201cThe equity for the entire commercial space was $120 million. Suddenly, Donald was saying that it was worth $500 million!\u201d \nWhen The Art of the Deal was published, he told The Wall Street Journal that the first printing would be 200,000. It was 50,000 fewer than that. \nWhen Charles Feldman of CNN questioned Trump in March about the collapse of his business empire, Trump stormed off the set. Later, he told Feldman\u2019s boss, Ted Turner, \u201cYour reporter threatened my secretary and made her cry.\u201d \nWhen the stock market collapsed, he announced that he had gotten out in time and had lost nothing. In fact, he had taken a beating on his Alexander\u2019s and American Airlines stock. \u201cWhat I said was, other than my Alexander\u2019s and American Airlines stock, I was out of the market,\u201d Trump told me swiftly. \nWhat forces in Donald Trump\u2019s background could have set off in him such a need for self-promotion? \nTen years ago, I went to visit Trump\u2019s father in his offices on Avenue Z on the border of Coney Island in Brooklyn. Fred Trump\u2019s own real-estate fortune had been made with the help of the Brooklyn political machine and especially Abe Beame. In the 1940s, Trump and Beame shared a close friend and lawyer, a captain in a Brooklyn political club named Bunny Lindenbaum. At that time, Beame worked in the city budget office; thirty years later he would become mayor of the city. Trump, Lindenbaum, and Beame often saw one another at dinner dances and fund-raisers of the Brooklyn political clubs. It is impossible to overestimate the power of these clubs in the New York of the 1950s; they created Fred Trump and gave him access to his largest acquisition, the seventy-five-acre parcel of city land that would become the 3,800-unit Trump Village. \nIn 1960, an immense tract of land off Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn became available for development. The City Planning Commission had approved a generous tax abatement for a nonprofit foundation to build a housing cooperative. Fred Trump attacked this abatement as \u201ca giveaway.\u201d Soon after, Trump himself decided to go after the tax abatement. Although the City Planning Commission had already approved the nonprofit plan, Lindenbaum went to see Mayor Robert Wagner, and Beame, who was in Wagner\u2019s camp, supported Trump. \nFred Trump wound up with two-thirds of the property, and within a year he had broken ground on Trump Village. Lindenbaum was given the City Planning Commission seat formerly held by Robert Moses, the power broker who built many of New York\u2019s highways, airports, and parks. The following year, Lindenbaum organized a fund-raising lunch for Wagner, who was running for re-election. Forty-three builders and landlords pledged thousands of dollars; Trump, according to reporter Wayne Barrett, pledged $2,500, one of the largest contributions. The lunch party made the front page of the newspapers, and Lindenbaum, disgraced, was forced off the commission. But Robert Wagner won the election, and Beame became his comptroller. \nIn 1966, as Donald was entering his junior year at the Wharton business school, Fred Trump and Lindenbaum were investigated for their role in a $60 million Mitchell-Lama mortgage. \u201cIs there any way of preventing a man who does business in that way from getting another contract with the state?\u201d the investigations-commission chairman asked about Trump and Lindenbaum. Ultimately, Trump was forced to return $1.2 million that he had overestimated on the land\u2014part of which money he had used to buy a site nearby on which to build a shopping center. \nFred Trump\u2019s office was pleasantly modest; the rooms were divided by glass partitions. The Trump Organization, as Donald had already grandly taken to calling his father\u2019s company, was a small cottage on the grounds of Trump Village. At the time, Donald told reporters that \u201cthe Trump Organization\u201d had 22,000 units, although it had about half that number. Fred Trump was seventy-five then, polite, but nobody\u2019s fool. He criticized many of his son\u2019s early deals, warning him at one point that expanding into Manhattan was \u201ca ticket on the Titanic .\u201d Donald ignored him. \u201cA peacock today, a feather duster tomorrow,\u201d the developer Sam Lefrak is said to have remarked of Donald Trump. But ten years ago it was clear that Donald was the embodiment of his father\u2019s dreams. \u201cI always tell Donald, \u2018The elevator to success is out of order. Go one step at a time,\u2019 \u201d Fred Trump told me. \u201cBut what do you think of what my Donald has put together? It boggles the mind!\u201d \nDonald Trump has always viewed his father as a role model. In The Art of the Deal , he wrote, \u201cFred Trump was born in New Jersey in 1905. His father, who came here from Sweden . . . owned a moderately successful restaurant.\u201d In fact, the Trump family was German and desperately poor. \u201cAt one point my mother took in stitching to keep us going,\u201d Trump\u2019s father told me. \u201cFor a time, my father owned a restaurant in the Klondike, but he died when I was young.\u201d Donald\u2019s cousin John Walter once wrote out an elaborate family tree. \u201cWe shared the same grandfather,\u201d Walter told me, \u201cand he was German. So what?\u201d \nAlthough Fred Trump was born in New Jersey, family members say he felt compelled to hide his German background because most of his tenants were Jewish. \u201cAfter the war, he thought that Jews would never rent from him if they knew his lineage,\u201d Ivana reportedly said. Certainly, Fred Trump\u2019s camouflage could easily convey to a child the impression that in business anything goes. When I asked Donald Trump about this, he was evasive: \u201cActually, it was very difficult. My father was not German; my father\u2019s parents were German . . . Swedish, and really sort of all over Europe . . . and I was even thinking in the second edition of putting more emphasis on other places because I was getting so many letters from Sweden: Would I come over and speak to Parliament? Would I come meet with the president?\u201d \nDonald Trump appears to take aspects of his German background seriously. John Walter works for the Trump Organization, and when he visits Donald in his office, Ivana told a friend, he clicks his heels and says, \u201c Heil Hitler,\u201d possibly as a family joke. \nLast April, perhaps in a surge of Czech nationalism, Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler\u2019s collected speeches, My New Order , which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of My New Order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler\u2019s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist. \n\u201cDid your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?\u201d I asked Trump. \nTrump hesitated. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I said. \n\u201cActually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of Mein Kampf , and he\u2019s a Jew.\u201d (\u201cI did give him a book about Hitler,\u201d Marty Davis said. \u201cBut it was My New Order , Hitler\u2019s speeches, not Mein Kampf. I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I\u2019m not Jewish.\u201d) \nLater, Trump returned to this subject. \u201c If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.\u201d \nIs Ivana trying to convince her friends and lawyer that Trump is a crypto-Nazi? Trump is no reader or history buff. Perhaps his possession of Hitler\u2019s speeches merely indicates an interest in Hitler\u2019s genius at propaganda. The F\u00fchrer often described his defeats at Stalingrad and in North Africa as great victories. Trump continues to endow his diminishing world with significance as well. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that has the cash flow that I have,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal long after he knew better. \u201cI want to be king of cash.\u201d \nFred Trump, like his son, has never resisted exaggeration. When Donald was a child, his father bought a house that \u201chad nine bathrooms and columns like Tara,\u201d Fred Trump said. The house, however, was in Queens. Donald would someday envision a larger world. It was Donald\u2019s mother, Mary, who revered luxury. \u201cMy mother had a sense of the grand,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI can remember her watching the coronation of Queen Elizabeth and being so fascinated by it. My father had no interest in that kind of thing at all.\u201d \nDonald Trump often went with his father to construction sites, for they were extraordinarily close, almost kindred spirits. In family photographs, Fred and Donald stand together, often arm in arm, while Donald\u2019s sisters and younger brother, Robert, seem off in the ether. Ivana has told friends that Donald even persuaded his father to put him in charge of his three siblings\u2019 trust funds. \nDonald was one of five children, the second son. As a child, he was so boisterous that his parents sent him away to military school. \u201cThat was the way it worked in the Trump family,\u201d a longtime friend told me. \u201cIt was not a loving atmosphere.\u201d Donald was chubby then, but military school slimmed him down. He became forceful, and grew even closer to his father. \u201cI had to fight back all the time,\u201d Trump once told me. \u201cThese guys like my father are tough. You have to be hitting back! Otherwise they don\u2019t respect you!\u201d \nFamily members say that the firstborn son, Fred junior, often felt shut out by the relationship between Donald and his father. As a young man, he announced his intention to be an airplane pilot. Later, according to a friend of Ivana\u2019s, Donald and his father often belittled Fred junior for this career choice. \u201cDonald would say, \u2018What is the difference between what you do and driving a bus? Why aren\u2019t you in the family real-estate business?\u2019 \u201d Fred junior became an alcoholic and died at age forty-three. Ivana has always told her close friends that she believed the pressure put on him by his father and his brother hastened his early death. \u201cPerhaps unknowingly [we did put pressure on him],\u201d Trump told me. \u201cWe assumed that [real estate] came rather easy to us and it should have come easily to him. I had success, and that put pressure on Fred too. What is this, a psychoanalysis of Donald?\u201d \nDonald\u2019s relationship with Robert has also had troubled moments. Robert, who did go into the family business, has always been \u201cthe nice guy,\u201d in his brother\u2019s shadow. There has been additional friction between Robert\u2019s wife, Blaine, and Ivana. Blaine is considered a workhorse for New York charities, and Robert and Blaine are extremely popular\u2014\u201cthe good Trumps,\u201d they are called. \u201cRobert and I feel that if we say anything about the family, then we become public people,\u201d Blaine told me. The brothers\u2019 suppressed hostility erupted after the opening of the Taj Mahal. \u201cRobert told Donald that if he didn\u2019t give him autonomy he would leave,\u201d Ivana told a friend. \u201cSo Donald did leave him alone, and there was a mess with the slot machines which cost Donald $3 million to $10 million in the first three days. When Donald exploded, Robert packed his boxes and left. He and Blaine went to her family for Easter.\u201d \nAs his father had had Bunny Lindenbaum for his fixer, Donald Trump had Roy Cohn, the Picasso of the inside fix. \u201cCohn taught Donald which fork to use,\u201d a friend told me. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my lawyer Roy Cohn with me,\u201d Trump often told city officials a decade ago, before he learned better. \u201cDonald calls me fifteen to twenty times a day,\u201d Cohn once told me. \u201cHe has a maddening attention to detail. He is always asking, \u2018What is the status of this? What is the status of that?\u2019 \u201d \nIn a Trump tax-abatement case, according to Cohn\u2019s biographer Nicholas von Hoffman, the judge was handed a piece of paper that looked like an affidavit. It had just one sentence on it: \u201cNo further delays or adjournments. Stanley M. Friedman.\u201d By then Friedman had become the county leader of the Bronx. It wasn\u2019t necessary to exchange money for such favors. This was a classic \u201cmarker\u201d; the power of suggestion of future favors was enough. \nFriedman had also been crucial to Trump\u2019s plans for the Commodore Hotel. \u201cIn the final days of the Beame administration,\u201d according to Wayne Barrett, \u201cFriedman rushed a $160 million, forty-year tax abatement . . . and actually executed the documents for the lame duck Beame.\u201d Friedman had already agreed to join Cohn\u2019s law firm, which was representing Trump. \u201cTrump lost his moral compass when he made an alliance with Roy Cohn,\u201d Liz Smith once remarked. \nIn New York, Trump soon became known for his confrontational style. He also became the largest contributor to Governor Hugh Carey of New York, except for Carey\u2019s brother. Trump and his father gave $135,000. He was moving quickly now; he had set himself up in a Fifth Avenue office and a Fifth Avenue apartment and had hired Louise Sunshine, Carey\u2019s chief of fund-raising, as his \u201cdirector of special projects.\u201d \u201cI knew Donald better than anyone,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re a team, Sunshine and Trump, and when people shove us, we shove harder.\u201d Sunshine had raised millions of dollars for Carey, and she had one of the greatest address books in the city. She took Donald to meet every city and state power broker and worked on the sale of the Trump Tower apartments. \nReal-estate tax is immensely complicated. Often profit-and-loss accounting does not run parallel with cash flow. Sometimes a developer can have tremendous cash flow and yet not report taxable earnings; tax laws also permit developers to have less cash flow and greater taxable earnings. It is up to the developer. When Donald Trump broke ground on a new apartment building at Sixty-first Street and Third Avenue, Louise Sunshine was given a 5 percent share of the new Trump Plaza, as it was called. \nThere was some friction in Sunshine\u2019s relationship with her boss. As a result of Trump\u2019s accounting on Trump Plaza, Louise Sunshine, according to a close friend, would have had to pay taxes of $1 million. \u201cWhy are you structuring Trump Plaza this way?\u201d she reportedly asked Donald. \u201cWhere am I going to get $1 million?\u201d \u201cSell me back your 5 percent share of Trump Plaza and you can have it,\u201d Trump said. \nSunshine was so stunned by this that she went to her friend billionaire Leonard Stern for help. \u201cI wrote out a check for $1 million on the spot so that my close friend would not find herself squeezed out by Donald,\u201d Stern told me. \u201cI said to Louise, \u2018You tell Trump that unless he treats you fairly you will litigate! And as a result, the details of his duplicitous treatment would not only come to the attention of the public but also to the Casino Control Commission.\u2019 \u201d Louise Sunshine hired Arthur Liman, who would later represent the financier Michael Milken, to handle her case. Liman worked out a settlement: Trump paid Louise Sunshine $2.7 million for her share of Trump Plaza. Sunshine repaid Leonard Stern. For several years, Trump and Sunshine had a cool relationship. But in fine New York style, they are now friends again. \u201cDonald never should have used his money as a power tool over me,\u201d Sunshine told me, adding, \u201cI have absolved him.\u201d \nLike Michael Milken, Trump began to believe that his inordinate skills could be translated into any business. He started to expand out of the familiar world of real estate into casinos, airlines, and hotels. With Citicorp as his enabler, he bought the Plaza and the Eastern shuttle. He managed them both surprisingly well, but he had paid too much for them. He always had the ready cooperation of the starstruck banks, which would later panic. A member of the board of the Chase Manhattan Bank recently demanded at a meeting, \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name were you thinking of to make these loans?\u201d No satisfactory answer was forthcoming; the Rockefeller bank had once kept Brazil afloat, too. The bankers, like the Brooklyn-machine hacks from Trump\u2019s childhood, were blame shufflers, frantic to keep the game going. \n\u201cYou cannot believe the money the banks were throwing at us,\u201d a former top legal associate of Trump\u2019s told me. \u201cFor every deal we did, we would have six or eight banks who were willing to give us hundreds of millions of dollars. We used to have to pick through the financings; the banks could not sign on fast enough to anything Donald conceived.\u201d \n\u201cHe bought more and more properties and expanded so much that he guaranteed his own self-destruction. His fix was spending money. Well, his quick fix became his Achilles\u2019 heel,\u201d a prominent developer told me. \nTrump\u2019s negotiations, according to one lawyer who worked on the acquisition of the Atlantic City casino of Resorts International, were always unusually unpleasant. After the success of The Art of the Deal , Trump\u2019s lawyers began to talk about \u201cDonald\u2019s ego\u201d as if it were a separate entity. \u201cDonald\u2019s ego will never permit us to accept that point,\u201d one lawyer said over and over again during the negotiations. \u201cThe key to Donald, like with any bully, is to tell him to go fuck himself,\u201d the lawyer told me. When Mortimer Zuckerman, the chairman and C.E.O. of Boston Properties, submitted a design that was chosen for the site of the Fifty-ninth Street coliseum, Trump became apoplectic. \u201cHe called everyone, trying to get his deal killed. Of course, Mort\u2019s partner was Salomon Brothers, so Trump got nowhere,\u201d a person close to Zuckerman remembered. \nOne image of Ivana and Donald Trump sticks in my memory. Wintertime, three years ago. They were at the Wollman Rink. Donald had just fixed it up for the city. He had been crowing in the newspapers about what dummies Mayor Koch and the city had been, wasting years and money and coming up with nothing on the skating rink. Trump had taken over the job and done it well. If he grabbed more of the credit than he deserved, no one really held it against him; the rink was open at last and filled with happy skaters. \nIvana was wearing a striking lynx coat which showed her blond hair to advantage. Their arms were around each other. They looked so very young and rich, living in the moment of their success. A polite crowd had gathered to congratulate them on the triumph of the rink. The people near Donald appeared to feel enlivened by his presence, as if he were a hero. His happiness seemed a reflection of the crowd\u2019s adulation. \nNext to me a man called out, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you negotiate the SALT talks for Reagan, Donald?\u201d Ivana beamed. The snow began falling very lightly; from the rink below you could hear \u201cThe Skaters\u2019 Waltz.\u201d \nSome months before the Trumps\u2019 separation, Donald and Ivana were due at a dinner party being given in their honor. The Trumps were late, and this was not a dinner to be taken lightly. The hosts had a family name that evoked the very history of New York, yet as if they had recognized another force coming up in the city, they were honoring Donald and Ivana Trump. \nTrump entered the room first. \u201cI had to tape the Larry King show,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on Larry King tonight.\u201d He seemed very restless. Trump paid little attention to his blonde companion, and no one in the room recognized Ivana until she began to speak. \u201cMy God! What has she done to herself?\u201d one guest asked. Ivana\u2019s Slavic cheeks were gone; her lips had been fluffed up into a pout. Her limbs had been resculpted, and her cleavage astonishingly enhanced. The guests were so confused by her looks that her presence created an odd mood. \nAll through dinner Donald fidgeted. He looked at his watch. He mentioned repeatedly that he was at that moment on the Larry King show, as if he expected the guests to get up from their places. He had been belligerent to King that night, and he wanted the guests to see him, perhaps to confirm his powers. \u201cDo you mind if I sit back a little? Because your breath is very bad\u2014it really is,\u201d he had told Larry King on national TV. \n\u201cCome on, Arnold! Pose with me! Come on!\u201d Ivana Trump called out to the designer Arnold Scaasi on a warm night this past June. They were at the Waldorf-Astoria, at an awards ceremony sponsored by the Fragrance Foundation, and Ivana was a presenter. The carpet was shabby in the Jade Room; the paparazzi were waiting to pounce. P.R. materials covered the tables of this \u201cmust do\u201d event, of the kind that often passes for New York social life. The most expensive couture dress looked, under the blue-green tint of the lights, cheap. \nI was surprised that she appeared. The day before, her husband\u2019s crisis with the banks had provided the headlines on all three of the local tabloids. TRUMP IN A SLUMP! cried the Daily News. One columnist even said Trump\u2019s problems were the occasion for city joy, and proposed a unity day. \u201cIvana! Ivana! Ivana!\u201d the photographers called out to her. Ivana smiled, as if she were a presidential candidate. She wore a full-skirted mint-green satin beaded gown; her hair was swept off her face in a chignon. However humiliated for her children\u2019s sake she may have felt by the bad publicity, she had elected to leave them at home that night. Ivana was at the Waldorf by 6:15 P.M., greeting reporters and paparazzi by name. She could not afford now to alienate the perfume establishment by canceling, for soon she would be merchandising a fragrance, and she would need their goodwill. \nIvana seemed determined to keep her new stature in the city of alliances, for her financial future depended on her being able to salvage the brand name. As a woman alone, with a reduced fortune, Ivana was entering a tough world. She had no Rothkos to hock and no important jewels. But she did have the name Ivana, and she was making plans to market scarves, perfumes, handbags, and shoes, as once her husband had been able to market the name Trump. \nSeveral feet away from us, the local CBS reporter was doing a stand-up for the evening news. The reporter was commenting on the unraveling of the Trump empire while Ivana was chatting with Scaasi and Est\u00e9e Lauder. Lauder, a tough businesswoman herself, had reportedly told Ivana several months earlier, \u201cGo back with Donald. It is a cold world out here.\u201d I was reminded of a crowd scene in Nathanael West\u2019s Day of the Locust. Ivana even allowed the CBS reporter to shove a microphone into her face. \u201cDonald and I are partners in marriage and in business. I will stand beside him through thick or thin, for better or worse,\u201d she told the reporters with bizarre aplomb. Ivana had become, like Donald, a double agent, able to project innocence and utter confidence. She had, in fact, almost turned into Donald Trump. \n\u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019ve made Ivana a very popular woman. I\u2019ve made a lot of satellites. Hey, whether it\u2019s Marla or Ivana. Marla can do any movie she wants to now. Ivana can do whatever she wants,\u201d Donald Trump told me on the phone. \n\u201cNew York City is a very tough place,\u201d Ivana Trump told me years ago. \u201cI\u2019m tough, too. When people give me a punch in the nose, I react by getting even tougher.\u201d We were walking through the rubble of the Commodore Hotel, which would soon reopen as the Grand Hyatt. Ivana had been given the responsibility of supervising all the decoration; she was hard at it, despite the fact that she was wearing a white wool Thierry Mugler jumpsuit and pale Dior shoes as she picked her way through the sawdust. \u201cI told you never to leave a broom like this in a room!\u201d she screamed at one worker. Screaming at her employees had become part of her hallmark, perhaps her way of feeling power. Later, in Atlantic City, she would become known for her obsession with cleanliness. \nThe phrase \u201cStockholm syndrome\u201d is now used by Ivana\u2019s lawyer Michael Kennedy to describe her relationship with Donald. \u201cShe had the mentality of a captive,\u201d Kennedy told me. \u201cAfter a while she couldn\u2019t fight her captor anymore, and she began to identify with him. Ivana is deaf, dumb, and blind when it comes to Donald.\u201d If Donald worked eighteen-hour days, so would Ivana. The Trumps hired two nannies and a bodyguard for their children. She went to work running Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, often spending two or three days a week there supervising the staff. \nDetermined to bring glamour to Trump Castle, she became famous for her attention to appearances, once moving a pregnant waitress, desperate for big tips, off the casino floor. The woman was placed in a distant lounge and given a clown\u2019s suit to disguise her condition. \nIn New York, Ivana did not resist her husband\u2019s grandiosity. Soon after Trump Tower was completed, the Trumps took possession of their triplex. Ivana\u2019s lawyers often talk about her love of the domestic arts and describe her homemade jams and jellies. Yet the kitchen of her city apartment, which she designed, is tiny, no more than a kitchenette, tiled with gold linoleum. \u201cThe children\u2019s wing has a kitchen, and that is where the nanny cooks,\u201d a friend said. The Trump living room has a beige onyx floor with holes carved out to fit the carpets. There is a waterfall cascading down a marble wall, an Italianate fountain, and the famous murals. Their bedroom had a glass wall filled with arrangements of silk flowers. After a time, Ivana tired of the d\u00e9cor. She called in a renowned decorator. \u201cWhat can I do with this interior?\u201d she reportedly asked him. \u201cAbsolutely nothing,\u201d he said. \nChristmas Eve, three years ago. Ivana had received another stack of legal documents the size of a telephone book. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she is said to have asked Donald. \u201cIt is our new nuptial agreement. You get $10 million. Sign it!\u201d \u201cBut I can\u2019t look at this now, it\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Ivana said. Donald pressed her, according to Kennedy. Trump seemed extraordinarily concerned that she sign the papers, perhaps because an Atlantic City photographer was threatening to blackmail him with photos he had taken of him and Marla Maples. However efficiently Ivana ran Trump Castle, she seemed terrified of her husband. She signed the papers giving her $10 million and the mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. Later, Trump would tell reporters, \u201cIvana has $25 million.\u201d \nThe tactics he used in business he now brought home. \u201cDonald began calling Ivana and screaming all the time: \u2018You don\u2019t know what you are doing!\u2019 \u201d one of Ivana\u2019s top assistants told me. \u201cWhen Ivana would hang up the phone, I would say, \u2018How can you put up with this?\u2019 and Ivana would say, \u2018Because Donald is right.\u2019 \u201d He began belittling her: \u201cThat dress is terrible.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re showing too much cleavage.\u201d \u201cYou never spend enough time with the children.\u201d \u201cWho would touch those plastic breasts?\u201d Ivana told her friends that Donald had stopped sleeping with her. She blamed herself. \u201cI think it was Donald\u2019s master plan to get rid of Ivana in Atlantic City,\u201d one of her assistants told me. \u201cBy then, Marla Maples was in a suite at the Trump Regency. Atlantic City was to be their playground.\u201d \nIvana had once warned her husband against Atlantic City. \u201cWhy expand somewhere where there is no airport?\u201d Trump, however, was determined to invest there, even though Las Vegas associates had told him that Nevada gaming had profit factors that could total $200 million a year. But by now Marla Maples was in Atlantic City, and it was close to New York. Trump had become, according to one friend, \u201cso focused on Marla he wasn\u2019t paying attention to his business.\u201d \nThough Ivana had established herself in Atlantic City to please Donald, her presence there now, with Marla on the scene, was an inconvenience to him. With the acquisition of the Plaza hotel, he could deliver an ultimatum: \u201cEither you act like my wife and come back to New York and take care of your children or you run the casino in Atlantic City and we get divorced.\u201d \n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she asked one of her assistants. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do what he says, I am going to lose him.\u201d \nTrump even called a press conference to announce Ivana\u2019s new position as the president of the Plaza hotel: \u201cMy wife, Ivana, is a brilliant manager. I will pay her one dollar a year and all the dresses she can buy!\u201d Ivana called her friends in tears. \u201cHow can Donald humiliate me this way?\u201d \n\u201cI think Marla is very different from her image,\u201d Donald Trump told me in July. \u201cHer image is that of a very good-looking buxom blonde.\u201d A Donna Rice? \u201cShe\u2019s much different than that. She\u2019s smart, she\u2019s very nice, and not ambitious. She could have made a fortune in the last six months if she had wanted to!\u201d \n\u201cHow could you have allowed Marla to be the No Excuses jeans girl?\u201d I asked Trump. \u201cBecause I figured she could make $600,000 for doing one day\u2019s work. For the negative publicity, I thought, that $600,000 she can live on the rest of her life,\u201d Trump told me. \nThis past February, Trump took off for Japan, telling reporters he would be attending the Mike Tyson fight. His real motive was reportedly to meet with bankers to try to sell the Plaza, for Arthur Andersen\u2019s November audit had been dire. As he was flying back, he was radioed on the plane. Liz Smith had broken the story of the Trumps\u2019 separation. The entire sordid history of Marla Maples and Ivana fighting on the Aspen ski slopes was all over the papers. Ivana had done to Donald what years ago he had done to Jay Pritzker in Nepal. From the airplane, Trump called Liz Smith. \u201cCongratulations on your story,\u201d he told her sarcastically. \u201cI have had it with Ivana. She\u2019s gotten to be like Leona Helmsley.\u201d \u201cShame on you, Donald!\u201d Smith replied. \u201cHow dare you say that about the mother of your children?\u201d \u201cJust write that someone from Howard Rubenstein\u2019s office said it,\u201d Trump told Smith, referring to his well-connected press agent. (\u201cI never said that,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cYes, he did,\u201d said Smith.) The Japanese bankers with whom Trump had negotiated a tentative sale suddenly backed off. \u201cThe Japanese despise scandal,\u201d one of their associates told me. \nSeveral weeks later, Donald called Ivana. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk down Fifth Avenue together for the photographers and pretend that this entire scandal has been a publicity stunt? We could say that we wanted to see who would side with you and who would side with me.\u201d As the press became more sympathetic to Ivana, Donald would scream at his lawyers, \u201cThis is bullshit!\u201d \nIvana began to repair old feuds all over town. \u201cWe can be friends now, Leonard, can\u2019t we?\u201d she said at a recent party, according to a friend of Leonard Stern\u2019s. \u201cYour problem was with Donald, never me. I always liked you.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s lawyers tried mightily to catch up with Ivana. \u201cDonald saw a bill this week that Ivana charged $7,000 worth of Pratesi sheets for their daughter, Ivancka,\u201d one lawyer said. \u201cHe called in a rage. \u2018Why does a seven-year-old need $7,000 worth of sheets?\u2019 She charged a $350 shirt at Montenapoleone. Who was that for, her new best friend, Jerry Zipkin?\u201d The lawyer described Ivana\u2019s bills from Carolina Herrera: \u201cWe will get a bill for $25,000, and Ivana will have photocopied over the invoice, so instead of one dress at $25,000, in her own handwriting she will write, \u2018Six items for $25,000.\u2019 \u201d (A spokesman for Ivana says that this is completely untrue.) \nThe scandal was seriously affecting the Trump children. Donny junior was being ridiculed at the Buckley School. Ivancka had been in tears at Chapin. When Donald and Marla Maples attended the same Elton John concert, Donny junior cried, for his father had told the children he would give Marla Maples up. \u201cThe children are all wrecks,\u201d Ivana told Liz Smith. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Donald can say they are great and fine. Ivancka now comes home from school crying, \u2018Mommy, does it mean I\u2019m not going to be Ivancka Trump anymore?\u2019 Little Eric asks me, \u2018Is it true you are going away and not coming back?\u2019 \u201d However cavalier Ivana\u2019s public behavior was, in private she often cried. Once her husband\u2019s co-conspirator, she told friends that she now felt she was his victim. \nOn the Saturday of Donald Trump\u2019s forty-fourth-birthday celebration, I tried to take a walk on the West Side yards above Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The railroad tracks were rusty, the land was overgrown. The property stretched on, block after block. It was cool by the Hudson River that morning, with a pleasant breeze whipping over the water. The only sign of Trump was a high storm fence topped with elaborate curls of barbed wire to keep out the homeless people who live nearby. It was on this land, at the height of his megalomania, that Trump said he would erect \u201cthe tallest building in the world,\u201d a plan which was successfully thwarted by neighborhood activists who were resistant to having parts of the West Side obscured in shadow. \u201cThey have no power,\u201d Trump said at the time, baffled that anyone would resist his grandiose schemes. \nIvana had left for London to take part in one more public-relations event promoting the Plaza, only this time her friends the Baron and Baroness Ricky di Portanova were rumored to be paying the bill. Ivana had had her New York media campaign orchestrated by John Scanlon, who had handled public relations for CBS during the Westmoreland libel case. In London, she was cosseted by Eleanor Lambert, the doyenne of fashion publicists. A story went around London that she couldn\u2019t afford her hotel and had moved in with a friend on Eaton Square. She was treading the same ground as Undine Spragg, who so carefully calculated her rise in Edith Wharton\u2019s The Custom of the Country. Sir Humphry Wakefield assembled a list of titled guests for a dinner, but there was friction between him and Ivana. When the guests, including the Duchess of Northumberland, arrived, many of them were displeased that they had been lured to a dinner which, to their surprise, was in honor of Ivana Trump. \u201cHumphry will pay for this,\u201d one guest reportedly said. \nThat Saturday, New York seemed oddly vacant without the Trumps. Donald had left for his birthday party in Atlantic City. Hundreds of casino employees had been told to be on the Boardwalk to greet him, since Manhattan boosters were in short supply. The day before, he had defaulted on $73 million owed to bondholders and bankers. Clowns and jesters borrowed from Trump\u2019s Xanadu attempted to entertain the waiting employees and reporters underneath Trump\u2019s minarets and elephants, which soon might be repossessed. \nTrump arrived very late, flanked by his bodyguards. His face was hard, his mouth set into a line. With an elaborate flourish, Trump\u2019s executives pulled a curtain to reveal his birthday tribute, a huge portrait of Donald Trump, the same image the Japanese stared at in his Manhattan tower. The size of the portrait was unsettling on the Atlantic City Boardwalk: ten feet of the Donald, leaning forward on his elbow, his face frozen in the familiar defiant smirk. \nWithin days, the bankers agreed to give Trump $65 million to pay his bills. Much of his empire would probably have to be dismantled, but he would retain control. His personal allowance would now be $450,000 a month. \u201cI can live with that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHowever absurd this sounds, it was smarter to do it this way than to let a judge preside over a fire sale in a bankruptcy court,\u201d one banker told me. Trump crowed about the bailout. \u201cThis is a great victory. It\u2019s a great agreement for everybody,\u201d he said. \nNot exactly. Trump\u2019s bankers were said to be so upset at Trump\u2019s balance sheet\u2014 he was reportedly over half a billion dollars in the hole\u2014that they demanded he sign over his future trust inheritance to secure the new loans. Trump\u2019s father, who had created him by helping him achieve his first deals, now seemed to be rescuing him again. \u201cTotal bullshit,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI have been given five years by the banks. The banks would never have asked me for my future inheritance, and I would never have given it.\u201d \nSoon after, Trump announced that the French department store Galeries Lafayette would take over the vast space Bonwit Teller had vacated in Trump Tower. \u201cThis is in no way a comeback,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cBecause I never went anywhere.\u201d \nI was still searching for Donald Trump. On a rainy Thursday in July, I went down to federal court, where he was set to testify in a civil case in which he was a defendant. Along with his contractor, Trump had been accused of hiring scores of illegal Polish aliens to do the demolition work on the Trump Tower site. \u201cThe Polish brigade,\u201d as they came to be called, had been astonishingly exploited on the job, earning four dollars an hour for work that usually paid five times that. \nThe last time I had been in this neighborhood was to hear the verdict in the John Gotti trial. I had come to know the area well. The guard inside greeted me by name. I was often here dipping in and out of the courtrooms to observe the notorious figures of the last decade. I thought of Bess Myerson, Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Leona Helmsley, Imelda Marcos, and Adnan Khashoggi, shattered and brought down in the crazy kaleidoscope of the 1980s. Each one had, at one time in his or her life, been thought to be like Donald Trump, a figure of greatness, anointed with special powers. In front of the courthouse, the police barricades were up. So many celebrities passed through these revolving doors that the yellow saw-horses were left routinely on the massive courthouse steps. \nI thought about the ten years since I had first met Donald Trump. It is fashionable now to say that he was a symbol of the crassness of the 1980s, but Trump became more than a vulgarian. Like Michael Milken, Trump appeared to believe that his money gave him a freedom to set the rules. No one stopped him. His exaggerations and baloney were reported, and people laughed. His bankers showered him with money. City officials almost allowed him to set public policy by erecting his wall of concrete on the Hudson River. New York City, like the bankers from the Chase and Manny Hanny, allowed Trump to exist in a universe where all reality had vanished. \u201cI met with a couple of reporters,\u201d Trump told me on the telephone, \u201cand they totally saw what I was saying. They completely believed me. And then they went out and wrote vicious things about me, as I am sure you will, too.\u201d Long ago, Trump had counted me among his enemies in his world of \u201cpositives\u201d and \u201cnegatives.\u201d I felt that the next dozen people he spoke to would probably be subjected to a catalogue of my transgressions as imagined by Donald Trump. \nWhen I got to the courtroom, Trump had gone. His lawyer, the venerable and well-connected Milton Gould, was smiling broadly, for he appeared to believe that he was wiping the floor with this case. Trump had said that he knew nothing about the demolitions, that his contractor had been \u201ca disaster.\u201d Yet one F.B.I. informant testified that he had warned Trump of the presence of the Polish brigade and had told him that if he didn\u2019t get rid of them his casino license might not be granted. \nI wandered down to the pressroom on the fifth floor to hear about Trump\u2019s testimony. The reporters sounded weary; they had heard it all before. \u201cGoddamn it,\u201d one shouted at me, \u201cwe created him! We bought his bullshit! He was always a phony, and we filled our papers with him!\u201d \nI thought about the last questions Donald Trump had asked me the day before on the telephone. \u201cHow long is your article?\u201d \u201cLong,\u201d I said. Trump seemed pleased. \u201cIs it a cover?\u201d he asked. Share ",

      "text": "Watch Seth Meyers explain what happened in Kansas when taxes were cut dramatically 2:10 a.m. ET \nIt's not every day that small business owners ask for their taxes to be raised, but that's what's happening in Kansas. \nAs Seth Meyers explains, Gov. Sam Brownback (R) cut taxes for the wealthy and eliminated income taxes for small businesses, saying it would be a \"real live experiment\" for conservative economic policies. \"That's a terrible sales pitch for something,\" Meyers quipped. \"Those words only usually show up in shady classified ads.\" Supporters said the cuts would somehow generate $323 million in new revenue, but they actually produced a $688 million loss, and the state got creative when it tried to close the gap, at one point taking adult items seized from a business that owed back taxes and auctioning them off online. \nNow, residents are complaining about budgets being slashed and business owners are rejecting the drastic tax cuts, leading Meyers to believe the results of the experiment are in. \"Republicans want to replicate these policies on a national level, but even when you buy couch cleaner they tell you to try it on a small patch of fabric first,\" he said. \"That's what happened here \u2014 Kansas was the small patch of fabric. Not only did the cleaner not work, the couch exploded.\" Watch the (in some parts racy) video below. Catherine Garcia \nSamantha Bee takes a moderate whack at GOP Supreme Court obstruction, and a poke at Joe Biden 2:14 a.m. ET \nEver since Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly, Senate Republicans \"have made it clear that they're going to hold the Supreme Court hostage like a Mexican housekeeper locking Richard Simmons up in the crawl space,\" Samantha Bee said on Monday's Full Frontal . President Obama \"fulfilled his constitutional duty to troll the Republicans soooo hard\" by naming a moderate nominee, Merrick Garland, that many of them had just lauded, Bee said, showing a clip of Fox News pundits freaking out over Obama's \"trap.\" But Senate Republicans were ready with some trolling of their own. \nTheir first gambit was repeating \"the Biden Rule\" ad nauseam to justify their court-blocking. \"Ah, yes, the Biden Rule that totally exists,\" Bee said. \"What is the Biden Rule again?\" After showing a brief clip of Biden saying something stupid, she rolled the video of him talking about judicial appointments \u2014 but she played all the relevant parts . \"Oh, so Color Me Bad\u2013era Biden said he'd support a moderate nominee from President Bush,\" Bee said. \"That's so great! If that's the rule, let's get on with moderate Merrick's hearing \u2014 tick tock, you don't stop.\" \nBut Republicans had a backup catch-phrase: Lame-duck Obama. \"He's not a lame duck \u2014 he's three trimesters away from from lame-duckery,\" Bee protested. \"A president's term is four years. You can't say only three of those are legitimate and the fourth is garbage \u2014 they're not Indiana Jones movies.\" Finally, she found one Republican senator, Jeff Flake (Ariz.), willing to consider confirming Garland, at least if Hillary Clinton wins. Bee took her poke at the vice president, and Flake: \"Oh, dude! Did you just embarrass your party by blurting out the thing you're not supposed to say in public? Finally, someone following the actual Biden Rule!\" Watch below. Peter Weber Sign Up for 10 things you need to know today Today's best articles Today's top cartoons Daily business briefing Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nTed Cruz's campaign would love to get Marco Rubio on a unity ticket, but his former rival doesn't share the enthusiasm, multiple sources told Politico . \nWanting to block Donald Trump from the nomination, Cruz is looking at all of his options, the sources say, and one senator willing to work as a middleman between the Cruz and Rubio camps is Mike Lee (R-Utah). He tried to get a meeting with Rubio before the Florida primary, which Rubio lost to Trump, but was rebuffed, Politico reports. Undeterred, Cruz's team spent the last week conducting polls in upcoming primary states to see how he would do running with Rubio, the sources said. If nothing else, Cruz's campaign would like a Rubio endorsement, and those close to Rubio say he's open to it, particularly if he thinks Cruz has a shot at beating Trump. \nOn Fox News Monday night, Cruz said he hasn't talked about a unity ticket with Rubio, but isn't ruling it out. \"I think any Republican would naturally have Marco on their short list and you would look seriously to him as a vice presidential choice,\" he said.

      "text": "WATCH: Video Proves Trump Manager Didn\u2019t Attack Heckler, Shows Something Far Worse \nIt is estimated that Trump\u2019s plan would add nearly $9.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years, but that figure may ignore the fact that lower tax rates and loosened regulations could actually bring in more revenue through a broadened tax base and increased productivity. \nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s tax plan, which is to virtually eliminate the IRS and tax code , to be replaced by a simple flat tax, would also see increases in take-home pay for all tax-paying brackets, with the average $55,000 worker bringing home an extra $55 per biweekly check. Advertisement - story continues below \nCruz\u2019s plan is also alleged to add to the federal deficit, to the tune of $8.6 trillion over 10 years, but again, that number could be discounted and changed by the implementation of other economy-motivating policies. \nSelf-declared socialist and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has unabashedly called for higher taxes on everyone, even the working class poor, in his efforts to redistribute all of the wealth and end income inequality by making everyone equally poor. The prototypical $55,000 worker would see a nearly $150 decrease in their paycheck. \nDespite the dramatically increased tax rates and ostensibly increased tax revenues, Sanders\u2019 plan would still add to the federal deficit as well, due to the fact that he would likely make few, if any cuts to the budget, and would instead add more government programs and spending, such as for truly universal single-payer health care and free college for everyone, among other handouts.

      "text": "CBC News Posted: Mar 22, 2016 11:08 AM ET Last Updated: Mar 22, 2016 11:12 AM ET \nRob Ford, the former Toronto mayor who polarized voters with his brash, uncompromising political style and became an international celebrity for his drug and alcohol use while in office, has died. He was 46. Ford died this morning after battling cancer since 2014. His death was confirmed by his chief of staff. \nOver his decade and a half in municipal politics, Ford won a devoted following for being a straight talker who championed the average taxpayer. He was equally defined by his apparent contradictions: a millionaire with a working-class attitude; a cost-cutting crusader who promoted subway expansion over less expensive transit solutions; and a man who while serving as mayor often seemed more interested in coaching high school football. It was a testament to his common touch that even as Ford faced a growing number of controversies related to drug use, public drunkenness and racist and sexist comments, many voters in the so-called \"Ford Nation\" continued to stand by him. \nHe, in turn, remained committed to them. \"I have made mistakes and all I can do right now is apologize for those mistakes,\" Ford said at a news conference in June 2014, after a two-month stint in rehab. \"I love the work that I do and I'm going to keep doing it. I want to keep working for the people of this city.\" Ford had everyman appeal despite having less-than-humble beginnings himself. He and his brothers worked for Deco Labels & Tags, the multimillion-dollar family business founded by his father, Doug Ford, Sr. The senior Ford later served as an Ontario MPP, a posting that inspired Rob and his brother Doug's entry into municipal politics. Rob Ford was elected councillor of Ward 2 Etobicoke North, a suburb in Toronto's west end, in 2000, and gained a reputation as a brash populist and cost-cutting crusader. Ford was so committed to addressing the concerns of his constituents that he made an effort to return every phone call personally, even going so far as to give out his home number. He showed his dedication to the community in other ways, too - for example, by hosting the annual Ford Fest summer barbecue, a free event open to the public, and by coaching a local high school football team. While his candid talk led to clashes with some of his fellow councillors, Ford gained a following for trying to reduce bureaucratic waste and show \"respect for the taxpayers.\" His promise to \"stop the gravy train\" at city hall became the central mantra of his 2010 mayoral campaign and ultimately lifted him to victory. Ford became mayor of Canada's biggest city by taking 47 per cent of the vote and outpacing his closest competitor by 10 points. Personal distractions Despite this electoral triumph, Ford's stint as mayor was contentious almost from the beginning, partly because of his politics and partly because of the increasing distractions of his personal life. \nFord's conservatism and criticism of \"downtown elites\" split council into opposing camps, which led to acrimonious debates, and often stalemates, on everything from budget cuts to union negotiations. One of Ford's biggest preoccupations was subways, which led to many council fights over transit expansion, which he insisted could not happen without more subways. City council under Ford nonetheless introduced a number of significant changes, including the repeal of the dreaded vehicle registration tax, outsourcing garbage collection in the city's west end and a deal with city workers that averted a strike. \nAt the same time, he was hit with a number of scandals, including a forensic audit of his campaign finances that found he had exceeded the authorized campaign spending limit by more than $40,000. \nAnother series of controversies involved his commitment to a high school football team in his constituency. \nFootball was a life-long passion for Ford. In addition to volunteering as coach of the Don Bosco Eagles, he established the Rob Ford Football Foundation, which provided funding and equipment to underprivileged youth. His love of the game eventually led to a number of controversies, including an incident in November 2012 in which a TTC bus was rerouted in order to pick up Don Bosco players after a game. Ford insisted he had \"nothing to do\" with it. That same month, a judge ordered the mayor removed from office after ruling that by sending letters to lobbyists requesting donations to his football foundation, Ford had violated the Municipal Elections Act. (Ford appealed and won.) While Ford managed to weather those controversies, things became more serious in May 2013, after reports emerged of a cellphone video that showed Ford smoking crack cocaine. A person claiming to have filmed the video showed it to reporters from the Toronto Star and U.S. gossip site Gawker and offered to sell it for \"six figures.\" Ford staunchly denied that he smoked crack and questioned the existence of the footage, which prompted Gawker to begin a crowd-funding campaign to buy the video. International celebrity \nThe story not only made Ford an international celebrity and the object of mockery on late-night talk shows, but it also triggered a criminal investigation, which eventually led police to acquire a copy of the video. After months of denying he was in the video, Ford confessed in November 2013 to having smoked crack, adding that it had likely occurred during one of his \"drunken stupors.\" \nDespite the acknowledgment, Ford refused to step down as mayor. Ford also called on Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair to release the video so Torontonians could judge the severity of the footage for themselves. \nConcerns about Ford's health and personal relationships led council to vote in favour of cutting his mayoral budget and hand many of his duties to Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly. In the months that followed, the controversy intensified with the release of other unflattering videos, including one in which Ford is seen shouting obscenities and using threatening language and another in which he appears inebriated and speaks in a Jamaican patois. Meanwhile, Toronto police investigated Ford's connections with Sandro Lisi, who was charged with extortion for what police say were efforts to recover a video that purportedly shows Ford smoking crack. \nIn February 2014, Robyn Doolittle, one of three reporters to have seen the original crack video, published Crazy Town, her book-length account of the Ford scandal. \nIn April, after the emergence of a second video allegedly showing Ford smoking crack, the mayor announced he was taking a two-month leave of absence to seek rehabilitation for drug and alcohol abuse. The cancer diagnosis \nFord returned to work in June. Despite his admitted problems, he continued to enjoy significant support in the 2014 mayoral election campaign. But in mid-September, Ford was diagnosed with a rare but aggressive type of malignant tumour in his abdomen. \nAs a result, he pulled out of the running for mayor, and instead ran as a councillor in Ward 2 while his brother, Doug, the existing councillor for Ward 2, joined the mayoral race in his stead. \nIn the Oct. 27 municipal election, Rob Ford handily won the seat for Ward 2, while his brother lost to John Tory in the mayoral race. \nIn May 2015, doctors removed a tumour from Rob Ford's abdomen. According to Ford aide Dan Jacobs, doctors at the time said they saw no signs of other tumours. \nFord kept a relatively low profile until the latter stages of the 2015 federal election campaign in October, when he was seen campaigning with Conservative Leader Stephen Harper. \nThis coincided with the release of two new books about Ford, including one by Mark Towhey, a former chief of staff, which recalled a phone call to Towhey in which Ford talked about \"putting three bullets\" in his wife Renata's head. \nIn the fall, Doug Ford confirmed that doctors had found two new tumours on his brother's bladder.

      "text": "Google\u2019s 200 Ranking Factors: The Complete List by Brian Dean | Last updated Mar. 21, 2016 You probably already know that Google uses about 200 ranking factors in their algorithm\u2026 But what the heck are they? Well today you\u2019re in for a treat because I\u2019ve put together a complete list. Some are proven. Others are SEO nerd speculation. But they\u2019re all here . Bonus: Download a free checklist that will show you how to tap into the 10 most important Google ranking factors listed here. Domain Factors 1. Domain Age: In this video , Matt Cutts states that: \u201cThe difference between a domain that\u2019s six months old versus one year old is really not that big at all.\u201d. In other words, they do use domain age\u2026but it\u2019s not very important. 2. Keyword Appears in Top Level Domain: Doesn\u2019t give the boost that it used to, but having your keyword in the domain still acts as a relevancy signal. After all, they still bold keywords that appear in a domain name. 3. Keyword As First Word in Domain: A domain that starts with their target keyword has an edge over sites that either don\u2019t have the keyword in their domain or have the keyword in the middle or end of their domain. 4. Domain registration length: A Google patent states: \u201cValuable (legitimate) domains are often paid for several years in advance, while doorway (illegitimate) domains rarely are used for more than a year. Therefore, the date when a domain expires in the future can be used as a factor in predicting the legitimacy of a domain\u201d. 5. Keyword in Subdomain Name: Moz\u2019s 2011 panel agreed that a keyword appearing in the subdomain can boost rankings: 6. Domain History: A site with volatile ownership (via whois) or several drops may tell Google to \u201creset\u201d the site\u2019s history, negating links pointing to the domain. 7. Exact Match Domain: EMDs may still give you an edge\u2026if it\u2019s a quality site. But if the EMD happens to be a low-quality site, it\u2019s vulnerable to the EMD update : 8. Public vs. Private WhoIs: Private WhoIs information may be a sign of \u201csomething to hide\u201d. Matt Cutts is quoted as stating at Pubcon 2006: \u201c\u2026When I checked the whois on them, they all had \u201cwhois privacy protection service\u201d on them. That\u2019s relatively unusual. \u2026Having whois privacy turned on isn\u2019t automatically bad, but once you get several of these factors all together, you\u2019re often talking about a very different type of webmaster than the fellow who just has a single site or so.\u201d 9. Penalized WhoIs Owner: If Google identifies a particular person as a spammer it makes sense that they would scrutinize other sites owned by that person. 10. Country TLD extension: Having a Country Code Top Level Domain (.cn, .pt, .ca) helps the site rank for that particular country\u2026but limits the site\u2019s ability to rank globally. Page-Level Factors 11. Keyword in Title Tag: The title tag is a webpage\u2019s second most important piece of content (besides the content of the page) and therefore sends a strong on-page SEO signal. 12. Title Tag Starts with Keyword : According to Moz data , title tags that starts with a keyword tend to perform better than title tags with the keyword towards the end of the tag: 13. Keyword in Description Tag: Another relevancy signal. Not especially important now, but still makes a difference. 14. Keyword Appears in H1 Tag: H1 tags are a \u201csecond title tag\u201d that sends another relevancy signal to Google, according to results from this correlation study : 15. Keyword is Most Frequently Used Phrase in Document: Having a keyword appear more than any other likely acts as a relevancy signal. 16. Content Length: Content with more words can cover a wider breadth and are likely preferred to shorter superficial articles. SERPIQ found that content length correlated with SERP position : 17. Keyword Density : Although not as important as it once was, keyword density is still something Google uses to determine the topic of a webpage. But going overboard can hurt you. 18. Latent Semantic Indexing Keywords in Content (LSI): LSI keywords help search engines extract meaning from words with more than one meaning (Apple the computer company vs. the fruit). The presence/absence of LSI probably also acts as a content quality signal. 19. LSI Keywords in Title and Description Tags: As with webpage content, LSI keywords in page meta tags probably help Google discern between synonyms. May also act as a relevancy signal. 20. Page Loading Speed via HTML: Both Google and Bing use page loading speed as a ranking factor. Search engine spiders can estimate your site speed fairly accurately based on a page\u2019s code and filesize. 21. Duplicate Content: Identical content on the same site (even slightly modified) can negatively influence a site\u2019s search engine visibility. 22. Rel=Canonical: When used properly , use of this tag may prevent Google from considering pages duplicate content. 23. Page Loading Speed via Chrome : Google may also use Chrome user data to get a better handle on a page\u2019s loading time as this takes into account server speed, CDN usage and other non HTML-related site speed signals. 24. Image Optimization: Images on-page send search engines important relevancy signals through their file name, alt text, title, description and caption. 25. Recency of Content Updates: Google Caffeine update favors recently updated content, especially for time-sensitive searches. Highlighting this factor\u2019s importance, Google shows the date of a page\u2019s last update for certain pages: 26. Magnitude of Content Updates : The significance of edits and changes is also a freshness factor. Adding or removing entire sections is a more significant update than switching around the order of a few words. 27. Historical Updates Page Updates: How often has the page been updated over time? Daily, weekly, every 5-years? Frequency of page updates also play a role in freshness. 28. Keyword Prominence : Having a keyword appear in the first 100-words of a page\u2019s content appears to be a significant relevancy signal. 29. Keyword in H2, H3 Tags : Having your keyword appear as a subheading in H2 or H3 format may be another weak relevancy signal. Moz\u2019s panel agrees: 30. Keyword Word Order: An exact match of a searcher\u2019s keyword in a page\u2019s content will generally rank better than the same keyword phrase in a different order. For example: consider a search for: \u201ccat shaving techniques\u201d. A page optimized for the phrase \u201ccat shaving techniques\u201d will rank better than a page optimized for \u201ctechniques for shaving a cat\u201d. This is a good illustration of why keyword research is really, really important. 31. Outbound Link Quality : Many SEOs think that linking out to authority sites helps send trust signals to Google. 32. Outbound Link Theme: According to Moz , search engines may use the content of the pages you link to as a relevancy signal. For example, if you have a page about cars that links to movie-related pages, this may tell Google that your page is about the movie Cars, not the automobile. 33. Grammar and Spelling: Proper grammar and spelling is a quality signal, although Cutts gave mixed messages in 2011 on whether or not this was important. 34. Syndicated Content: Is the content on the page original? If it\u2019s scraped or copied from an indexed page it won\u2019t rank as well as the original or end up in their Supplemental Index . 35. Helpful Supplementary Content: According to a now-public Google Rater Guidelines Document , helpful supplementary content is an indicator of a page\u2019s quality (and therefore, Google ranking). Examples include currency converters, loan interest calculators and interactive recipes. 36. Number of Outbound Links: Too many dofollow OBLs may \u201cleak\u201d PageRank, which can hurt that page\u2019s rankings. 37. Multimedia: Images, videos and other multimedia elements may act as a content quality signal. 38. Number of Internal Links Pointing to Page: The number of internal links to a page indicates its importance relative to other pages on the site. 39. Quality of Internal Links Pointing to Page : Internal links from authoritative pages on domain have a stronger effect than pages with no or low PR. 40. Broken Links: Having too many broken links on a page may be a sign of a neglected or abandoned site. The Google Rater Guidelines Document uses broken links as one was to assess a homepage\u2019s quality. 41. Reading Level: There\u2019s no doubt that Google estimates the reading level of webpages. In fact, Google used to give you reading level stats: But what they do with that information is up for debate. Some say that a basic reading level will help you rank better because it will appeal to the masses. But others associate a basic reading level with content mills like Ezine Articles. 42. Affiliate Links : Affiliate links themselves probably won\u2019t hurt your rankings. But if you have too many, Google\u2019s algorithm may pay closer attention to other quality signals to make sure you\u2019re not a \u201cthin affiliate site\u201d. 43. HTML errors/W3C validation : Lots of HTML errors or sloppy coding may be a sign of a poor quality site. While controversial, many in SEO think that WC3 validation is a weak quality signal. 44. Page Host\u2019s Domain Authority : All things being equal, a page on an authoritative domain will rank higher than a page on a domain with less authority. 45. Page\u2019s PageRank: Not perfectly correlated. But in general higher PR pages tend to rank better than low PR pages. 46. URL Length: Search Engine Journal notes that excessively long URLs may hurt search visibility. 47. URL Path : A page closer to the homepage may get a slight authority boost. 48. Human Editors: Although never confirmed, Google has filed a patent for a system that allows human editors to influence the SERPs. 49. Page Category: The category the page appears on is a relevancy signal. A page that\u2019s part of a closely related category should get a relevancy boost compared to a page that\u2019s filed under an unrelated or less related category. 50. WordPress Tags: Tags are WordPress-specific relevancy signal. According to Yoast.com : \u201cThe only way it improves your SEO is by relating one piece of content to another, and more specifically a group of posts to each other\u201d 51. Keyword in URL : Another important relevancy signal. 52. URL String: The categories in the URL string are read by Google and may provide a thematic signal to what a page is about: 53. References and Sources: Citing references and sources, like research papers do, may be a sign of quality. The Google Quality Guidelines states that reviewers should keep an eye out for sources when looking at certain pages: \u201cThis is a topic where expertise and/or authoritative sources are important\u2026\u201d. However, Google has denied that they use external links as a ranking signal. 54. Bullets and Numbered Lists: Bullets and numbered lists help break up your content for readers, making them more user friendly. Google likely agrees and may prefer content with bullets and numbers. 55. Priority of Page in Sitemap: The priority a page is given via the sitemap.xml file may influence ranking. 56. Too Many Outbound Links: Straight from the aforementioned Quality rater document: \u201cSome pages have way, way too many links, obscuring the page and distracting from the Main Content\u201d 57. Quantity of Other Keywords Page Ranks For: If the page ranks for several other keywords it may give Google an internal sign of quality. 58. Page Age: Although Google prefers fresh content, an older page that\u2019s regularly updated may outperform a newer page. 59. User Friendly Layout: Citing the Google Quality Guidelines Document yet again: \u201cThe page layout on highest quality pages makes the Main Content immediately visible\u201d 60. Parked Domains : A Google update in December of 2011 decreased search visibility of parked domains. 61. Useful Content: As pointed out by Backlinko reader Jared Carrizales , Google may distinguish between \u201cquality\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d content . Site-Level Factors \n62. Content Provides Value and Unique Insights: Google has stated that they\u2019re on the hunt for sites that don\u2019t bring anything new or useful to the table, especially thin affiliate sites. 63. Contact Us Page: The aforementioned Google Quality Document states that they prefer sites with an \u201cappropriate amount of contact information\u201d. Supposed bonus if your contact information matches your whois info. 64. Domain Trust/TrustRank: Site trust \u2014 measured by how many links away your site is from highly-trusted seed sites \u2014 is a massively important ranking factor. You can read more about TrustRank here . 65. Site Architecture: A well put-together site architecture (especially a silo structure) helps Google thematically organize your content. 66. Site Updates: How often a site is updated \u2014 and especially when new content is added to the site \u2014 is a site-wide freshness factor. 67. Number of Pages: The number of pages a site has is a weak sign of authority. At the very least a large site helps distinguish it from thin affiliate sites. 68. Presence of Sitemap: A sitemap helps search engines index your pages easier and more thoroughly, improving visibility. 69. Site Uptime : Lots of downtime from site maintenance or server issues may hurt your ranking (and can even result in deindexing if not corrected). 70. Server Location : Server location may influence where your site ranks in different geographical regions. Especially important for geo-specific searches. 71. SSL Certificate : Google has confirmed that they index SSL certificates and that they use HTTPS as a ranking signal. 72. Terms of Service and Privacy Pages : These two pages help tell Google that a site is a trustworthy member of the internet. 73. Duplicate Meta Information On-Site : Duplicate meta information across your site may bring down all of your page\u2019s visibility. 74. Breadcrumb Navigation: This is a style of user-friendly site-architecture that helps users (and search engines) know where they are on a site: Both SearchEngineJournal.com and Ethical SEO Consulting claim that this set-up may be a ranking factor. 75. Mobile Optimized: Google\u2019s official stance on mobile is to create a responsive site. It\u2019s likely that responsive sites get an edge in searches from a mobile device. In fact, they now add \u201c Mobile friendly\u201d tags to sites that display well on mobile devices. Google also started penalizing site s in Mobile search that aren\u2019t mobile friendly 76. YouTube: There\u2019s no doubt that YouTube videos are given preferential treatment in the SERPs (probably because Google owns it ): In fact, Search Engine Land found that YouTube.com traffic increased significantly after Google Panda . Video Tutorial: Advanced YouTube SEO Secrets 77. Site Usability: A site that\u2019s difficult to use or to navigate can hurt ranking by reducing time on site, pages viewed and bounce rate. This may be an independent algorithmic factor gleaned from massive amounts of user data. 78. Use of Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools: Some think that having these two programs installed on your site can improve your page\u2019s indexing. They may also directly influence rank by giving Google more data to work with (ie. more accurate bounce rate, whether or not you get referral traffic from your backlinks etc.). 79. User reviews/Site reputation: A site\u2019s on review sites like Yelp.com and RipOffReport.com likely play an important role in the algorithm. Google even posted a rarely candid outline of their approach to user reviews after an eyeglass site was caught ripping off customers in an effort to get backlinks. Backlink Factors \n80. Linking Domain Age: Backlinks from aged domains may be more powerful than new domains. \n81. # of Linking Root Domains: The number of referring domains is one of the most important ranking factors in Google\u2019s algorithm, as you can see from this chart from Moz (bottom axis is SERP position): \n82. # of Links from Separate C-Class IPs: Links from separate class-c IP addresses suggest a wider breadth of sites linking to you. \n83. # of Linking Pages : The total number of linking pages \u2014 even if some are on the same domain \u2014 is a ranking factor. \n84. Alt Tag (for Image Links) : Alt text is an image\u2019s version of anchor text. \n85. Links from .edu or .gov Domains : Matt Cutts has stated that TLD doesn\u2019t factor into a site\u2019s importance. However, that doesn\u2019t stop SEOs from thinking that there\u2019s a special place in the algo for .gov and .edu TLDs. \n86. Authority of Linking Page: The authority (PageRank) of the referring page is an extremely important ranking factor. \n87. Authority of Linking Domain : The referring domain\u2019s authority may play an independent role in a link\u2019s importance (ie. a PR2 page link from a site with a homepage PR3 may be worth less than a PR2 page link from PR8 Yale.edu). \n88. Links From Competitors: Links from other pages ranking in the same SERP may be more valuable for a page\u2019s rank for that particular keyword. \n89. Social Shares of Referring Page : The amount of page-level social shares may influence the link\u2019s value. \n90. Links from Bad Neighborhoods: Links from \u201cbad neighborhoods\u201d may hurt your site . \n91. Guest Posts: Although guest posting can be part of a white hat SEO campaign , links coming from guest posts \u2014 especially in an author bio area \u2014 may not be as valuable as a contextual link on the same page. \n92. Links to Homepage Domain that Page Sits On: Links to a referring page\u2019s homepage may play special importance in evaluating a site\u2019s \u2014 and therefore a link\u2019s \u2014 weight. \n93. Nofollow Links: One of the most controversial topics in SEO. Google\u2019s official word on the matter is: \u201cIn general, we don\u2019t follow them.\u201d \nWhich suggests that they do\u2026 at least in certain cases. Having a certain % of nofollow links may also indicate a natural vs. unnatural link profile. \n94. Diversity of Link Types: Having an unnaturally large percentage of your links come from a single source (ie. forum profiles, blog comments) may be a sign of webspam. On the other hand, links from diverse sources is a sign of a natural link profile. \n95. \u201cSponsored Links\u201d Or Other Words Around Link: Words like \u201csponsors\u201d, \u201clink partners\u201d and \u201csponsored links\u201d may decrease a link\u2019s value. \n96. Contextual Links: Links embedded inside a page\u2019s content are considered more powerful than links on an empty page or found elsewhere on the page. \nA good example of contextual links are backlinks from guestographics . \n97. Excessive 301 Redirects to Page: Links coming from 301 redirects dilute some (or even all) PR, according to a Webmaster Help Video . \n98. Backlink Anchor Text : As noted in this description of Google\u2019s original algorithm: \u201cFirst, anchors often provide more accurate descriptions of web pages than the pages themselves.\u201d Obviously, anchor text is less important than before (and likely a webspam signal). But it still sends a strong relevancy signal in small doses. \n99. Internal Link Anchor Text : Internal link anchor text is another relevancy signal, although probably weighed differently than backlink anchor text. \n100. Link Title Attribution : The link title (the text that appears when you hover over a link) is also used as a weak relevancy signals. \n101. Country TLD of Referring Domain: Getting links from country-specific top level domain extensions (.de, .cn, .co.uk) may help you rank better in that country. \n102. Link Location In Content: Links in the beginning of a piece of content carry slightly more weight than links placed at the end of the content. \n103. Link Location on Page: Where a link appears on a page is important. Generally, links embedded in a page\u2019s content are more powerful than links in the footer or sidebar area. \n104. Linking Domain Relevancy: A link from site in a similar niche is significantly more powerful than a link from a completely unrelated site. That\u2019s why any effective SEO strategy today focuses on obtaining relevant links. \n105. Page Level Relevancy: The Hilltop Algorithm states that link from a page that\u2019s closely tied to page\u2019s content is more powerful than a link from an unrelated page. \n106. Text Around Link Sentiment: Google has probably figured out whether or not a link to your site is a recommendation or part of a negative review. Links with positive sentiments around them likely carry more weight. \n107. Keyword in Title: Google gives extra love to links on pages that contain your page\u2019s keyword in the title (\u201cExperts linking to experts\u201d.) \n108. Positive Link Velocity: A site with positive link velocity usually gets a SERP boost. \n109. Negative Link Velocity: Negative link velocity can significantly reduce rankings as it\u2019s a signal of decreasing popularity. \n110. Links from \u201cHub\u201d Pages: Aaron Wall claims that getting links from pages that are considered top resources (or hubs) on a certain topic are given special treatment. \n111. Link from Authority Sites: A link from a site considered an \u201cauthority site\u201d likely pass more juice than a link from a small, microniche site. \n112. Linked to as Wikipedia Source: Although the links are nofollow, many think that getting a link from Wikipedia gives you a little added trust and authority in the eyes of search engines. \n113. Co-Occurrences: The words that tend to appear around your backlinks helps tell Google what that page is about . \n114. Backlink Age: According to a Google patent , older links have more ranking power than newly minted backlinks. \n115. Links from Real Sites vs. Splogs: Due to the proliferation of blog networks, Google probably gives more weight to links coming from \u201creal sites\u201d than from fake blogs. They likely use brand and user-interaction signals to distinguish between the two. \n116. Natural Link Profile: A site with a \u201cnatural\u201d link profile is going to rank highly and be more durable to updates. \n117. Reciprocal Links: Google\u2019s Link Schemes page lists \u201cExcessive link exchanging\u201d as a link scheme to avoid. \n118. User Generated Content Links: Google is able to identify links generated from UGC vs. the actual site owner. For example, they know that a link from the official WordPress.com blog at en.blog.wordpress.com is very different than a link from besttoasterreviews.wordpress.com. \n119. Links from 301: Links from 301 redirects may lose a little bit of juice compared to a direct link. However, Matt Cutts says that a 301 is similar to a direct link. \n120. Schema.org Microformats: Pages that support microformats may rank above pages without it. This may be a direct boost or the fact that pages with microformatting have a higher SERP CTR: \n121. DMOZ Listed : Many believe that Google gives DMOZ listed sites a little extra trust. \n122. TrustRank of Linking Site: The trustworthiness of the site linking to you determines how much \u201cTrustRank\u201d gets passed onto you. \n123. Number of Outbound Links on Page: PageRank is finite. A link on a page with hundreds of OBLs passes less PR than a page with only a few OBLs. \n124. Forum Profile Links: Because of industrial-level spamming, Google may significantly devalue links from forum profiles. \n125. Word Count of Linking Content: A link from a 1000-word post is more valuable than a link inside of a 25-word snippet. \n126. Quality of Linking Content: Links from poorly written or spun content don\u2019t pass as much value as links from well-written, multimedia-enhanced content. \n127. Sitewide Links: Matt Cutts has confirmed that sitewide links are \u201ccompressed\u201d to count as a single link. Video Tutorial: My Go-To Link Building Strategy User Interaction 128. Organic Click Through Rate for a Keyword : Pages that get clicked more in CTR may get a SERP boost for that particular keyword. 129. Organic CTR for All Keywords : A page\u2019s (or site\u2019s) organic CTR for all keywords is ranks for may be a human-based, user interaction signal. 130. Bounce Rate: Not everyone in SEO agrees bounce rate matters, but it may be a way of Google to use their users as quality testers (pages where people quickly bounce is probably not very good). 131. Direct Traffic: It\u2019s confirmed that Google uses data from Google Chrome to determine whether or not people visit a site (and how often). Sites with lots of direct traffic are likely higher quality than sites that get very little direct traffic. 132. Repeat Traffic : They may also look at whether or not users go back to a page or site after visiting. Sites with repeat visitors may get a Google ranking boost. 133. Blocked Sites : Google has discontinued this feature in Chrome. However, Panda used this feature as a quality signal. 134. Chrome Bookmarks: We know that Google collects Chrome browser usage data . Pages that get bookmarked in Chrome might get a boost. 135. Google Toolbar Data: Search Engine Watch\u2019s Danny Goodwin reports that Google uses toolbar data as a ranking signal. However, besides page loading speed and malware, it\u2019s not known what kind of data they glean from the toolbar. 136. Number of Comments: Pages with lots of comments may be a signal of user-interaction and quality. 137. Dwell Time: Google pays very close attention to \u201cdwell time\u201d: how long people spend on your page when coming from a Google search. This is also sometimes referred to as \u201clong clicks vs short clicks\u201d. If people spend a lot of time on your site, that may be used as a quality signal. Special Algorithm Rules 138. Query Deserves Freshness: Google gives newer pages a boost for certain searches . 139. Query Deserves Diversity: Google may add diversity to a SERP for ambiguous keywords, such as \u201cTed\u201d, \u201cWWF\u201d or \u201cruby\u201d. 140. User Browsing History : Sites that you frequently visit while signed into Google get a SERP bump for your searches. 141. User Search History: Search chain influence search results for later searches . For example, if you search for \u201creviews\u201d then search for \u201ctoasters\u201d, Google is more likely to show toaster review sites higher in the SERPs. 142. Geo Targeting: Google gives preference to sites with a local server IP and country-specific domain name extension. 143. Safe Search: Search results with curse words or adult content won\u2019t appear for people with Safe Search turned on. 144. Google+ Circles: Google shows higher results for authors and sites that you\u2019ve added to your Google Plus Circles 145. DMCA Complaints: Google \u201cdownranks\u201d pages with DMCA complaints . 146. Domain Diversity : The so-called \u201c Bigfoot Update \u201d supposedly added more domains to each SERP page. 147. Transactional Searches : Google sometimes displays different results for shopping-related keywords, like flight searches. 148. Local Searches: Google often places Google+ Local results above the \u201cnormal\u201d organic SERPs. 149. Google News Box: Certain keywords trigger a Google News box: 150. Big Brand Preference: After the Vince Update , Google began giving big brands a boost for certain short-tail searches. 151. Shopping Results: Google sometimes displays Google Shopping results in organic SERPs: 152. Image Results: Google elbows our organic listings for image results for searches commonly used on Google Image Search. 153. Easter Egg Results: Google has a dozen or so Easter Egg results . For example, when you search for \u201cAtari Breakout\u201d in Google image search, the search results turn into a playable game (!). Shout out to Victor Pan for this one. 154. Single Site Results for Brands: Domain or brand-oriented keywords bring up several results from the same site . Video Tutorial: 5 Advanced Keyword Research Strategies Social Signals 155. Number of Tweets: Like links, the tweets a page has may influence its rank in Google. 156. Authority of Twitter Users Accounts : It\u2019s likely that Tweets coming from aged, authority Twitter profiles with a ton of followers (like Justin Bieber) have more of an effect than tweets from new, low-influence accounts. 157. Number of Facebook Likes : Although Google can\u2019t see most Facebook accounts , it\u2019s likely they consider the number of Facebook likes a page receives as a weak ranking signal. 158. Facebook Shares: Facebook shares \u2014 because they\u2019re more similar to a backlink \u2014 may have a stronger influence than Facebook likes . 159. Authority of Facebook User Accounts: As with Twitter, Facebook shares and likes coming from popular Facebook pages may pass more weight. 160. Pinterest Pins: Pinterest is an insanely popular social media account with lots of public data. It\u2019s probably that Google considers Pinterest Pins a social signal. 161. Votes on Social Sharing Sites: It\u2019s possible that Google uses shares at sites like Reddit, Stumbleupon and Digg as another type of social signal. 162. Number of Google+1\u2019s: Although Matt Cutts gone on the record as saying Google+ has \u201c no direct effect \u201d on rankings, it\u2019s hard to believe that they\u2019d ignore their own social network. 163. Authority of Google+ User Accounts: It\u2019s logical that Google would weigh +1\u2019s coming from authoritative accounts more than from accounts without many followers. 164. Known Authorship : In February 2013, Google CEO Eric Schmidt famously claimed: \u201cWithin search results, information tied to verified online profiles will be ranked higher than content without such verification, which will result in most users naturally clicking on the top (verified) results.\u201d \nAlthough the Google+ authorship program has been shut down , it\u2019s likely Google uses some form of authorship to determine influential content producers online (and give them a boost in rankings). 165. Social Signal Relevancy: Google probably uses relevancy information from the account sharing the content and the text surrounding the link. 166. Site Level Social Signals: Site-wide social signals may increase a site\u2019s overall authority, which will increase search visibility for all of its pages. Brand Signals 167. Brand Name Anchor Text: Branded anchor text is a simple \u2014 but strong \u2014 brand signal. 168. Branded Searches: It\u2019s simple: people search for brands. If people search for your site in Google (ie. \u201cBacklinko twitter\u201d, Backlinko + \u201cranking factors\u201d), Google likely takes this into consideration when determining a brand. 169. Site Has Facebook Page and Likes: Brands tend to have Facebook pages with lots of likes. 170. Site has Twitter Profile with Followers: Twitter profiles with a lot of followers signals a popular brand. 171. Official Linkedin Company Page: Most real businesses have company Linkedin pages. 172. Employees Listed at Linkedin: Rand Fishkin thinks that having Linkedin profiles that say they work for your company is a brand signal. 173. Legitimacy of Social Media Accounts: A social media account with 10,000 followers and 2 posts is probably interpreted a lot differently than another 10,000-follower strong account with lots of interaction. 174. Brand Mentions on News Sites : Really big brands get mentioned on Google News sites all the time. In fact, some brands even have their own Google News feed on the first page: 175. Co-Citations : Brands get mentioned without getting linked to. Google likely looks at non-hyperlinked brand mentions as a brand signal. 176. Number of RSS Subscribers: Considering that Google owns the popular Feedburner RSS service , it makes sense that they would look at RSS Subscriber data as a popularity/brand signal. 177. Brick and Mortar Location With Google+ Local Listing: Real businesses have offices. It\u2019s possible that Google fishes for location-data to determine whether or not a site is a big brand. 178. Website is Tax Paying Business: Moz reports that Google may look at whether or not a site is associated with a tax-paying business. On-Site WebSpam Factors 179. Panda Penalty : Sites with low-quality content (particularly content farms ) are less visible in search after getting hit by a Panda penalty . 180. Links to Bad Neighborhoods: Linking out to \u201cbad neighborhoods\u201d\u2014 like pharmacy or payday loan sites \u2014 may hurt your search visibility. 181. Redirects: Sneaky redirects is a big no-no . If caught, it can get a site not just penalized, but de-indexed. 182. Popups or Distracting Ads: The official Google Rater Guidelines Document says that popups and distracting ads is a sign of a low-quality site. 183. Site Over-Optimization: Includes on-page factors like keyword stuffing, header tag stuffing, excessive keyword decoration. 184. Page Over-Optimization: Many people report that \u2014 unlike Panda \u2014 Penguin targets individual page (and even then just for certain keywords). 185. Ads Above the Fold : The \u201c Page Layout Algorithm \u201d penalizes sites with lots of ads (and not much content) above the fold. 186. Hiding Affiliate Links: Going too far when trying to hide affiliate links (especially with cloaking) can bring on a penalty. 187. Affiliate Sites: It\u2019s no secret that Google isn\u2019t the biggest fan of affiliates . And many think that sites that monetize with affiliate links are put under extra scrutiny. 188. Autogenerated Content: Google isn\u2019t a big fan of autogenerated content. If they suspect that your site\u2019s pumping out computer-generated content, it could result in a penalty or de-indexing. 189. Excess PageRank Sculpting: Going too far with PageRank sculpting \u2014 by nofollowing all outbound links or most internal links \u2014 may be a sign of gaming the system. 190. IP Address Flagged as Spam: If your server\u2019s IP address is flagged for spam, it may hurt all of the sites on that server . 191. Meta Tag Spamming: Keyword stuffing can also happen in meta tags. If Google thinks you\u2019re adding keywords to your meta tags to game the algo, they may hit your site with a penalty. Off Page Webspam Factors 192. Unnatural Influx of Links : A sudden (and unnatural) influx of links is a sure-fire sign of phony links. 193. Penguin Penalty: Sites that were hit by Google Penguin are significantly less visible in search. 194. Link Profile with High % of Low Quality Links: Lots of links from sources commonly used by black hat SEOs (like blog comments and forum profiles) may be a sign of gaming the system. 195. Linking Domain Relevancy: The famous analysis by MicroSiteMasters.com found that sites with an unnaturally high amount of links from unrelated sites were more susceptible to Penguin. 196. Unnatural Links Warning: Google sent out thousands of \u201cGoogle Webmaster Tools notice of detected unnatural links\u201d messages. This usually precedes a ranking drop, although not 100% of the time . 197. Links from the Same Class C IP : Getting an unnatural amount of links from sites on the same server IP may be a sign of blog network link building. 198. \u201cPoison\u201d Anchor Text: Having \u201cpoison\u201d anchor text (especially pharmacy keywords) pointed to your site may be a sign of spam or a hacked site. Either way, it can hurt your site\u2019s ranking. 199. Manual Penalty: Google has been known to hand out manual penalties, like in the well-publicized Interflora fiasco . 200. Selling Links: Selling links can definitely impact toolbar PageRank and may hurt your search visibility. 201. Google Sandbox: New sites that get a sudden influx of links are sometimes put in the Google Sandbox , which temporarily limits search visibility. 202. Google Dance: The Google Dance can temporarily shake up rankings. According to a Google Patent , this may be a way for them to determine whether or not a site is trying to game the algorithm. 203. Disavow Tool: Use of the Disavow Tool may remove a manual or algorithmic penalty for sites that were the victims of negative SEO. 204. Reconsideration Request : A successful reconsideration request can lift a penalty. 205. Temporary Link Schemes: Google has (apparently) caught onto people that create \u2014 and quickly remove \u2014 spammy links. Also know as a temporary link scheme . \u201cHow Can I Use This Information For My Site?\u201d \nI created a free step-by-step checklist that you can use to quickly apply the most important information from this post to your site. \nThe checklist contains the 10 most important ranking factors on this list\u2026 \n\u2026and super-actionable strategies that you can use to get higher rankings and more traffic. \nClick below to download the free checklist: ",

      "text": "Consulates in U.S. Promote Citizenship For Immigrants Charm Offensive Seeks to bolster Image of Mexico in U.S. Share on Facebook \nMexico is mounting an unprecedented effort to turn its permanent residents in the U.S. into citizens, a status that would enable them to vote -- presumably against Donald Trump. \nOfficially, Mexico says it respects U.S. sovereignty and has no strategy to influence the result of the presidential race. Yet Mexican diplomats are mobilizing for the first time to assist immigrants in gaining U.S. citizenship, hosting free workshops on naturalization. \n\"This is a historic moment where the Mexican consulate will open its doors to carry out these types of events in favor of the Mexican community,\" Adrian Sosa, a spokesman for the consulate in Chicago, said before an event on March 19. In Dallas, about 250 permanent residents attended the consulate\u2019s first \"citizenship clinic\" in February and another 150 in its second in March. In Las Vegas, the turnout topped 500. \nUnderscoring the fine line that separates participation from interfering in another country\u2019s election, Sosa noted that the consulate only hosts the event but it\u2019s community organizations who offer the advice. \nMexico may have the most at stake but it\u2019s not alone among U.S. allies bewildered by -- and worried about -- the reality-television star\u2019s success in the Republican primaries. Trump, who launched his campaign with invective directed at Mexico and a promise to build a border wall (with a \u201cbig beautiful door\u201d), identified himself last week as his own top foreign-policy adviser. \n\"I\u2019m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I\u2019ve said a lot of things,\" Trump said on MSNBC when asked who he speaks with consistently on foreign policy. \"My primary consultant is myself and I have a good instinct for this stuff.\" \nWith even senior U.S. Republicans, such as 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, pledging to contest Trump\u2019s nomination to the end, views from other major capitals comprise both concern and calm. An official close to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who asked not be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly said a Trump presidency would be a risk for the global economy and security. Trump has targeted Japan, along with Mexico and China, as nations where the U.S. is \"getting absolutely crushed on trade.\" \nThe government in China still believes it\u2019s too early to focus on Trump given that he hasn\u2019t yet won the Republican nomination, according to a Foreign Ministry official who asked not to be named. The sentiment is shared in France, where President Francois Hollande\u2019s administration says that the U.S. election takes a backseat to addressing migrant crisis, the war in Syria and terrorism threats. Right to Vote \nJoel Diaz doesn\u2019t want to wait to see how it all turns out. The Mexican-American, who has been a permanent resident of the U.S. for six years, arrived at the Mexican consulate in Chicago on Saturday with his wife and four adult sons to register all of them as U.S. citizens in order to vote against Trump. \n\"We\u2019re very worried,\" Diaz, 47, an evangelical pastor, said. \"If he wins there will be a lot of damage against a lot of people here, and to us as Hispanics, as Mexicans.\" \nLaura Espinosa, deputy consul in Mexico\u2019s consulate in Las Vegas, said the main goal of the program is citizenship, and while that includes the right to vote, the government doesn\u2019t press people to do so. \"Those who use this to vote, that\u2019s up to each individual,\" said Espinosa, who confirmed that most consulates have begun citizenship campaigns. \"We don\u2019t have any opinion on that, because that would be totally interfering in internal affairs of the country.\" \nThe government in Mexico City is holding off on engaging the Trump campaign directly until he becomes the nominee, said Francisco Guzman, chief of staff to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Speaking with reporters on March 1, Guzman said the government plans to communicate with the campaigns of the nominees once they\u2019re chosen and try to dispel what it considers misinformation about Mexico and Mexicans. Campaign Rhetoric \nThe public-relations offensive now under way includes using news outlets and social media to highlight the strides Mexicans have made in business, the arts and academia in the U.S., said Paulo Carreno, the former spokesman of Citigroup Inc.\u2019s Mexico unit who oversees the country\u2019s international branding strategy. \nPromoting Mexico in the U.S., from its scholars to artists, is meant \"not to influence an election, but a whole generation and those that follow,\" Carreno said in an e-mailed response to questions. \"The strategy will be an important anchor in our consular network in the country.\" \nWhile Guzman said the administration understands the difference between campaign rhetoric and governing proposals, Pena Nieto this month in an interview with newspaper El Universal compared Trump\u2019s rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. \nThe urgency and their numbers underscore why Mexican-Americans can have an impact. \nAbout 12 million Mexicans live in the U.S. and almost half lack legal status, according to a November study by the Pew Research Center. About 2.7 million legal Mexican permanent residents of the U.S. are eligible to apply to become citizens, according to The New Americans Campaign, a nonpartisan group that helps people access naturalization services. \nAli Noorani, executive director of National Immigration Forum, a non-partisan Washington-based policy group that advocates on behalf of immigrants, said Trump\u2019s rhetoric and proposals have spurred interest in registering to vote among Mexican immigrant communities, particularly in Nevada, Colorado and Virginia. \nBoosting turnout among immigrant voters could help tip the scale in the election, said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. \n\"Trump is exactly the kind of Republican who could mobilize legalized immigrant voters and others sympathetic to liberalized immigration policy,\" Zelizer said in an e-mailed response to questions. \"This has been one issue where he has not been very vague and taking an extremely tough and aggressive stance. I suspect that if he was the nominee you could see very high turnout in certain states for Democrats as a result of this issue.\" ",

      "text": "Many Cubans welcome closer ties with U.S. Story highlights The presidential trip to Havana is the culmination of a three-year effort to restore ties to the island The regime in Havana has shown little movement toward improving human rights or opening its state-run economy Havana (CNN) President Barack Obama touched down in Cuba on Sunday , definitively ending a half-century of estrangement in a dramatic personal demonstration of his core foreign policy principle of engaging America's enemies. It's a shift that the change-minded president hopes will nudge the Communist government here to grant more freedoms to its people and open new economic channels for American businesses. The President and his allies also hope a successful d\u00e9tente will offer something bigger: a lasting example of diplomacy's power in dealing with longtime foes. Obama stepped from Air Force One carrying an umbrella as a persistent rain fell on the tarmac. Before he emerged, he sent a message to Cuba on Twitter: \"\u00bfQue bol\u00e1 Cuba?\" he wrote, using an informal Cuban greeting. \"Just touched down here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people.\" \u00bfQue bol\u00e1 Cuba? Just touched down here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people. \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) March 20, 2016 His first stop in Havana: a meeting with staff at the newly reopened U.S. embassy. The final verdict on Obama's Cuba policy has yet to be rendered. The regime in Havana has shown little movement toward improving human rights or opening its state-run economy, and Obama admitted this week that Congress isn't likely to lift a longstanding trade embargo before he leaves office in January 2017. Read More But the sight of Air Force One landing at Havana's Jose Marti Airport in the early evening on Sunday nonetheless represents a diplomatic metamorphosis that few could have imagined even five years ago. \"My view is that this is the beginning, not the end, of what is going to be a journey that takes some time,\" Obama told CNN in an interview ahead of the trip. U.S. eases restrictions on Cuba links as Obama visit nears \"This is a matter of us engaging directly with the Cuban people and being able to have candid, tough conversations directly with the Cuban government,\" Obama said. \"We will have more influence and have greater capacity to advocate on behalf of the values that we care about when we're actually talking to them.\" The presidential trip to Havana is the culmination of a three-year effort to restore ties to the island, which sits 90 miles from Key West, Florida, but has long been off-limits for most American visitors. For decades, the island was regarded as a Cold War adversary, a forbidden place run by bearded strongmen that residents fled on makeshift rafts. Following in the path of the Obamas With his family in tow, Obama hopes to change that perception, highlighting the country's emerging private economy and meeting with outspoken opponents of the Castro regime. Before he departed, Obama met with Cuban-Americans in a bid to garner support for his diplomatic thaw, which is still met with skepticism among many in the large Cuban diaspora in South Florida and elsewhere. Several of the participants in the meeting will join Obama on his trip. With relaxed restrictions on who can travel to Cuba, many more Americans will now able to follow the Obamas' lead . And administration officials hope improved economic ties can foster a new dynamic between individual Cubans and Americans. U.S. airlines sign up for commercial flights to Cuba But critics of Obama's policy, including outspoken Cuban-American members of Congress such as Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and Democrat Robert Menendez, argue the opening only rewards an authoritarian regime -- one that has yet to show much sign of reform. Obama will tend to the Cuban government while here, sitting for his third bilateral meeting with leader Raul Castro since taking office and participate in the usual trappings of an official presidential visit, including a formal welcoming ceremony and a state dinner at the Revolutionary Palace. But he'll also peel away for less formal encounters, allowing the presidential spotlight to also shine on ordinary Cubans living in a new era. He'll address the Cuban people during a speech broadcast on state television and meet with anti-Castro dissidents. He's expected to take in the faded colonial beauty of Old Havana alongside his wife, daughters and mother-in-law. And before he departs Tuesday, Obama will watch the Cuban national baseball team play the Tampa Bay Rays, in town for an exhibition game as U.S. Major League Baseball works to update immigration rules for Cuban players . The sight of a sitting American president setting foot on the island will be a novelty for most Cubans. The last U.S. leader to visit was Calvin Coolidge, who voyaged into Havana Harbor on a battleship in 1928. This time, Obama's aides want to project a far different image. Cuba's Internet isolation beginning to lift \"There's great anticipation here for the visit,\" said Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top American diplomat in the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana. \"We want to broaden the engagement underway.\" That engagement began in December 2014, when Obama announced he was working to reopen long-frozen diplomatic ties to the island. The declaration was punctuated by the release of Alan Gross, an American prisoner in Cuba, in exchange for Cubans held in American jails. Since then, the U.S. government has steadily removed restrictions on travel and commerce between the neighboring countries. Last week, officials announced some of the biggest changes, including allowing Cubans to open U.S. bank accounts and permitting Americans to travel here individually, rather than as a group, for educational or cultural reasons. You've got mail The first mail flight between the two countries since 1968 arrived in Havana from Miami on Wednesday, carrying on it a letter from Obama to a Havana coffee shop owner, a response to a series of missives he'd received ahead of his trip. It's still difficult to get here as an American; charter flights remain the only option until U.S. carriers resume regular flights later this year. But once those flights are underway, U.S. officials expect a steady flow of American visitors that will outlast Obama's presidency. \"We very much want to make the process of normalization irreversible,\" said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser and a chief draftsman of the Cuba policy. What you need to know before traveling to Cuba Rhodes and Obama have cited Cuba -- along with a brokered deal with Iran to end its nuclear program -- as successful evidence of the President's 2009 inaugural vow to \"extend a hand\" to traditional U.S. foes. But without congressional action to lift a longstanding trade embargo, there's little Obama can do to fully restore economic ties to Cuba. He told CNN he didn't expect lawmakers to take action while he's in office. \"My strong prediction is that sometime in the next president's administration, whether they are a Democrat or a Republican, that the embargo in fact will be removed,\" he said. The current Congress has shown little appetite for such a move. \"There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights,\" Rubio, at the time a GOP presidential candidate, said during a CNN debate last week . \"In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening.\" He continued, \"The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.\" While most Republicans in Congress have expressed little interest in lifting the blanket restrictions, Obama has found some bipartisan support. \"If there's one policy that has aided the Castros, that's kept them in power, it's the travel ban and the embargo,\" Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who will travel with Obama to Cuba, told CNN in an interview. \"It's given them a convenient excuse for the failure of socialism. So we ought to remove that crutch. We're doing so. And I think we'll move ahead more quickly now.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Sections",

Ted Cruz (R-TX) to remove individuals from his national security advisory team which CAIR has labeled \u201cinfamous Islamophobes.\u201d \nCruz announced his robust 23-member national security coalition on Thursday. \nOn Thursday, CAIR released the following declaration: \nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today called on GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to drop designated hate group leader Frank Gaffney Jr., retired Lieutenant General William G. \u201cJerry\u201d Boykin and other Islamophobes as foreign policy advisers. \nCAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad stated, \u201cWho a candidate picks for his or her advisers says volumes about that candidate\u2019s worldview. By choosing infamous Islamophobes as foreign policy advisers, Senator Cruz indicates that he subscribes to their conspiratorial worldview and to the anti-Muslim bigotry that would inevitably shape their policy recommendations. We ask Senator Cruz to drop any adviser who has a past history of promoting conspiracy theories or religious bigotry.\u201d \nFederal prosecutors named CAIR an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation\u2019s Hamas-funding operation. \nThe organization cited the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as designating Gaffney\u2019s Center for Security Policy (CSP) as a \u201chate group.\u201d In a February article published by Breitbart News, Gaffney denounced the \u201chate-mongering of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\u201d \nCAIR also called out Cruz Security Team members Clare Lopez and Fred Fleitz of Gaffney\u2019s Center for Security Policy. Cruz coalition member Andrew McCarthy was also called out by name. \nGaffney is founder and president of the Center for Security Policy. In December, Gaffney described the organization to CNN\u2019s Don Lemon,:\u201cIt\u2019s a group that I started with a number of my colleagues back in 1988, essentially to promote what President Reagan, my old boss, used to call a strategy of peace through strength.\u201d \nIn February, CAIR executive director Nihad Awad accused Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of crossing \u201cthe line from spreading hatred to inciting violence.\u201d \nFour members of Cruz\u2019s national security coalition were identified as having served in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration, five served or participated in some facet of the George W. or George H. W. Bush administrations, and one member that served as a former aide to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana Read More Stories About: \nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

      "text": "Many Cubans welcome closer ties with U.S. Story highlights The presidential trip to Havana is the culmination of a three-year effort to restore ties to the island The regime in Havana has shown little movement toward improving human rights or opening its state-run economy Havana (CNN) President Barack Obama touched down in Cuba on Sunday , definitively ending a half-century of estrangement in a dramatic personal demonstration of his core foreign policy principle of engaging America's enemies. It's a shift that the change-minded president hopes will nudge the Communist government here to grant more freedoms to its people and open new economic channels for American businesses. The President and his allies also hope a successful d\u00e9tente will offer something bigger: a lasting example of diplomacy's power in dealing with longtime foes. Just before Obama stepped from Air Force One -- carrying an umbrella as a persistent rain fell on the tarmac -- he sent a message to Cubans on a platform that until recently would have been unheard of in the repressive regime. \"\u00bfQue bol\u00e1 Cuba?\" he wrote on Twitter, using an informal Cuban greeting. \"Just touched down here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people.\" \u00bfQue bol\u00e1 Cuba? Just touched down here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people. \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) March 20, 2016 On Sunday, his interactions with everyday Cubans were carefully calibrated. He toured the Cathedral of the Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception, greeting Cardinal Jaime Ortega, a key proponent of improving ties between the U.S. and Cuba. Crowds had gathered in the faded colonial streets of Old Havana to glimpse Obama and his family as they passed through on foot. Read More Later in the evening, Obama dined at a \"paladar\" -- one of hundreds of privately-run restaurants that only recently became permissible in the state-run economy. Those types of businesses -- along with new investments from American firms -- give U.S. officials hope that Cuba is on a path to finally opening its economy after decades of isolation. But he final verdict on Obama's Cuba policy has yet to be rendered. Those economic changes have been slow, and human rights are still blatantly ignored in parts of the island. That was illustrated Sunday, when scores of anti-Castro dissidents from the group Ladies in White were arrested and detained after their weekly protest in Havana. CNN witnessed dozens of protesters being driven from the site in buses. Jose Daniel Ferrer, a Cuban dissident who was imprisoned for eight years beginning in 2008, said Obama could act like President Ronald Reagan, demanding immediate improvements in human rights just as Reagan demanded the Soviet Union \"tear down this wall.\" But Ferrer, speaking in an interview with CNN in his home Sunday, conceded that even incremental change is beneficial to the island's politically oppressed citizenry. \"Obama's visit is good for the people and good for the cause,\" he said. Ferrer is among the dissidents meeting Obama on Tuesday. Challenges aside, the sight of Air Force One landing at Havana's Jose Marti Airport in the early evening on Sunday nonetheless represented a diplomatic metamorphosis that few could have imagined even five years ago. \"My view is that this is the beginning, not the end, of what is going to be a journey that takes some time,\" Obama told CNN in an interview ahead of the trip. U.S. eases restrictions on Cuba links as Obama visit nears \"This is a matter of us engaging directly with the Cuban people and being able to have candid, tough conversations directly with the Cuban government,\" Obama said. \"We will have more influence and have greater capacity to advocate on behalf of the values that we care about when we're actually talking to them.\" The presidential trip to Havana is the culmination of a three-year effort to restore ties to the island, which sits 90 miles from Key West, Florida, but has long been off-limits for most American visitors. For decades, the island was regarded as a Cold War adversary, a forbidden place run by bearded strongmen that residents fled on makeshift rafts. Following in the path of the Obamas With his family in tow, Obama hopes to change that perception, highlighting the country's emerging private economy and meeting with outspoken opponents of the Castro regime. Before he departed, Obama met with Cuban-Americans in a bid to garner support for his diplomatic thaw, which is still met with skepticism among many in the large Cuban diaspora in South Florida and elsewhere. Several of the participants in the meeting will join Obama on his trip. With relaxed restrictions on who can travel to Cuba, many more Americans will now able to follow the Obamas' lead . And administration officials hope improved economic ties can foster a new dynamic between individual Cubans and Americans. U.S. airlines sign up for commercial flights to Cuba But critics of Obama's policy, including outspoken Cuban-American members of Congress such as Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and Democrat Robert Menendez, argue the opening only rewards an authoritarian regime -- one that has yet to show much sign of reform. Obama will tend to the Cuban government while here, sitting Monday for his third bilateral meeting with leader Raul Castro since taking office and participating in the usual trappings of an official presidential visit, including a formal welcoming ceremony and a state dinner at the Revolutionary Palace. But he'll also peel away for less formal encounters, allowing the presidential spotlight to also shine on ordinary Cubans living in a new era, including during an address to the Cuban people during a speech broadcast on state television, and the meeting with anti-Castro dissidents. Before he departs Tuesday, Obama will watch the Cuban national baseball team play the Tampa Bay Rays, in town for an exhibition game as U.S. Major League Baseball works to update immigration rules for Cuban players . The sight of a sitting American president setting foot on the island will be a novelty for most Cubans. The last U.S. leader to visit was Calvin Coolidge, who voyaged into Havana Harbor on a battleship in 1928. This time, Obama's aides want to project a far different image. Cuba's Internet isolation beginning to lift \"There's great anticipation here for the visit,\" said Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top American diplomat in the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana. \"We want to broaden the engagement underway.\" That engagement began in December 2014, when Obama announced he was working to reopen long-frozen diplomatic ties to the island. The declaration was punctuated by the release of Alan Gross, an American prisoner in Cuba, in exchange for Cubans held in American jails. Since then, the U.S. government has steadily removed restrictions on travel and commerce between the neighboring countries. Last week, officials announced some of the biggest changes, including allowing Cubans to open U.S. bank accounts and permitting Americans to travel here individually, rather than as a group, for educational or cultural reasons. You've got mail The first mail flight between the two countries since 1968 arrived in Havana from Miami on Wednesday, carrying on it a letter from Obama to a Havana coffee shop owner, a response to a series of missives he'd received ahead of his trip. It's still difficult to get here as an American; charter flights remain the only option until U.S. carriers resume regular flights later this year. But once those flights are underway, U.S. officials expect a steady flow of American visitors that will outlast Obama's presidency. \"We very much want to make the process of normalization irreversible,\" said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser and a chief draftsman of the Cuba policy. What you need to know before traveling to Cuba Rhodes and Obama have cited Cuba -- along with a brokered deal with Iran to end its nuclear program -- as successful evidence of the President's 2009 inaugural vow to \"extend a hand\" to traditional U.S. foes.

(March 18) Associated Press Play Pause Seek i Volume Volume Volume Mute Unmute CC SETTINGS OFF HQ HD HQ SD LO Full Screen Exit Full Screen Play Pause Volume Volume\nHAVANA, March 20 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama arrived to small but cheering crowds on Sunday at the start of a historic visit to Cuba that opened a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the island's Communist government after decades of hostility between the former Cold War foes.\nThe three-day trip, the first by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years, is the culmination of a diplomatic opening announced by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014, ending an estrangement that began when the Cuban revolution ousted a pro-American government in 1959.\n\"It's a historic opportunity to engage directly with the Cuban people,\" Obama told staff at the newly reopened U.S. Embassy who were gathered at a hotel, his first stop after arriving in the afternoon.\nGroups of Cubans watched the motorcade from balconies and backyards as Obama was driven downtown, where a small crowd of Cubans braved a tropical downpour and tight security. They chanted: \"Viva Obama, Viva Fidel,\" as the president and his family left after eating dinner in a rundown neighborhood.\nObama, who abandoned a longtime U.S. policy of trying to isolate Cuba, wants to make his policy shift irreversible even if a Republican wins the White House in the Nov. 8 election.\nBut major obstacles remain to full normalization of ties, and the Democratic president's critics say the visit is premature. U.S. officials concede the trip may not yield immediate concessions from Cuba on rights and economic freedom.\nOn Sunday, one bystander shouted: \"Down with the blockade,\" in reference to the U.S. embargo in place for 54 years that remains the top irritant for Cubans. Obama, who responded to the shout by raising his right hand, has asked Congress to rescind the embargo but has been blocked by the Republican leadership.\nUnderscoring the ideological divide that persists between Washington and Havana, Cuban police, backed by hundreds of pro-government demonstrators, broke up the regular march of a leading dissident group, the Ladies in White, detaining about 50 people just hours before Obama arrived.\nIn Pictures: US President Obama's historic Cuba visit AIR FORCE ONE IN CUBA\nObama arrived at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport in Air Force One, the presidential jet with \"United States of America\" emblazoned across its fuselage, a sight almost unimaginable not long ago on the island, just 90 miles (145 km) off the coast of Florida.\nHe was met by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, the top Cuban official present. The formal welcoming ceremony will be on Monday when Obama meets the Cuban president at the presidential palace.\nU.S. officials appeared unfazed by Castro's absence from the airport welcome, even though he personally met and greeted Pope Francis in September. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump tweeted that Obama's visit was a \"big deal\" but that he got \"no respect.\"\nObama will hold talks with Castro - but not his brother Fidel, the revolutionary leader - and speak to entrepreneurs on Monday. He meets privately with dissidents, addresses Cubans live on state-run media and attends an exhibition baseball game on Tuesday.\nThe trip carries both symbolism and substance after decades of hostility between Washington and Havana.\nTraveling with first lady Michelle Obama, her mother and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, Obama took in the sights of the colonial-era neighborhood and was given a tour of Havana's 18th century cathedral by Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a role in secret talks that led to the rapprochement 15 months ago.\nThe Obamas dined at the San Cristobal restaurant, run by an Afro-Cuban as part of a cautious opening to private enterprise since Fidel Castro handed power to his brother in 2008.\nThe trip makes Obama the first sitting American president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge arrived on a battleship in 1928 and may help chip away at barriers to U.S.-Cuba trade and travel.\nSince rapprochement, the two sides have restored diplomatic ties and signed commercial deals on telecommunications and scheduled airline service.\nObama has used executive authority to loosen trade and travel restrictions to advance his outreach to Cuba, one of his top foreign policy priorities along with the Iran nuclear deal.\nCuba still complains about U.S. control of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay under a 1934 lease agreement that Havana says is no longer valid and that Obama has said is not up for discussion. Havana is unhappy with U.S. support for dissidents and anti-communist radio and TV programs beamed into Cuba.\nSpeaking to reporters, Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment minister Rodrigo Malmierca D\u00edaz said before the U.S. president's arrival that Obama's regulatory moves \"go in the right direction.\" But he added: \"We can't reach a normalization of relations with the blockade still in effect.\"\n'\u00bfQU\u00c9 BOL\u00c1 CUBA?'\nThe Americans in turn criticize one-party rule and repression of political opponents, an issue that aides said Obama would address publicly and privately.\nObama's critics at home accuse him of making too many concessions for too little in return from the Cuban government and of using his trip to take an unearned \"victory lap.\"\nObama's first words to the Cuban people came in a message on Twitter, a social media service that few Cubans can use regularly because of government restrictions on Internet access.\n\"\u00bfQu\u00e9 bol\u00e1 Cuba?\" he said, using Cuban slang for \"what's up?\"\n\"Just touched down here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people.\"\nLittle progress on the main issues is expected when Obama and Castro meet on Monday or at a state dinner that evening.\nInstead, the highlights are likely to be Obama's speech on live Cuban television on Tuesday, when he will also meet dissidents and attend an exhibition baseball game between Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays and Cuba's national team.\n(Additional reporting by Jeff Mason aboard Air Force One, and Frank Jack Daniel, Marc Frank and Nelson Acosta in Havana; Editing by Mary Milliken, Alan Crosby and Peter Cooney) \u00a9 REUTERS/Carlos Barria U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle approach Cuba's foreign minister Bruno Rodriguez (L) as they arrive at Havana's international airport for a three-day trip, in Havana March 20, 2016.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Democratic senators of all stripes are as impressed as they are surprised by Bernie Sanders\u2019 insurgent campaign. But the time has come, they say, for Sanders to start winding things down.\nAfter holding their fire on Sanders for the better part of a year, the senators \u2014 all backers of Hillary Clinton \u2014 are gently calling on Sanders to face the reality that there\u2019s almost no chance he\u2019s going to be the Democratic nominee. They don\u2019t say outright he should quit; doing so would be counterproductive, they say.\nBut nearly a dozen Democratic lawmakers suggested in interviews that Sanders should focus more on stopping Donald Trump and less on why he believes Clinton\u2019s stands on trade, financial regulation and foreign policy would make her a flawed president.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is not whether or not he gets out, but how he campaigns,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). \u201cIf the contrast is now about what separates us from Donald Trump, then I think it\u2019s fine. I just hope that we can begin to focus on unifying because obviously a lot of us are perplexed that we could be facing a country led by someone who seems to be a buffoon.\u201d\nAdded Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.): \u201cIt\u2019s good [for Sanders] to continue to raise the concerns that people have, but I think it ought to be in the context of, \u2018This is the difference between the Democrats and Republicans in this race.\u2019\u201d\nThe subtext of these comments is the general view among Democrats that Sanders has no path to win. Clinton has nearly double the number of delegates that Sanders has, and she swept the Vermont independent in three distinct regions of the country last week.\n\u201cIt will be almost impossible for Sen. Sanders to catch up. And he should do the math and draw his own conclusions,\u201d said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.).\n\u201cThe writing\u2019s on the wall,\u201d said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).\nThe message senators are airing publicly mirrors what President Barack Obama told donors in private recently, according to The New York Times: That while Clinton may have her faults as a candidate, the party needs to channel its energy into defeating Trump.\nTHE POLITICO CAUCUS\nInsiders: Kasich could win a contested convention By Steven Shepard\nOver the past month, Clinton campaign staffers have bristled at the way Sanders is running. A Clinton campaign memo said Sanders has been \u201cincreasingly negative\u201d and accused him of breaking his vows not to name Clinton in his ads, blaming his sweeping losses on a negative strategy that \u201cbackfired.\u201d\nWhile tame compared with the accusations of lying and name-calling that dominate the Republican race, Sanders has gone after Clinton more aggressively of late. In the run-up to the Illinois primary, he highlighted her ties to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who\u2019s unpopular among African-American voters and distrusted by progressives. And Sanders has repeatedly dismissed Clinton supporters as part of the \u201cestablishment,\u201d which Democratic senators interpret as showing disrepect for them.\nStill, Democratic leaders say they\u2019re confident Sanders will do the right thing in the end. As pointed as some of his barbs at Clinton have been, they argue, the self-described democratic socialist hasn\u2019t gone overboard.\n\u201cBernie is a very constructive person. And he wants to move American politics closer in his direction. He\u2019s done that already,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the expected next Democratic leader. \u201cI am not worried.\u201d\nThe Sanders campaign dismissed any suggestion that it\u2019s time to wrap up his long-shot bid and pivot to defeating Trump and the Republicans. Campaign spokesman Michael Briggs insisted Sanders is still a superior general election candidate because he \u201cconsistently draws much more support than she does in general election matchups with the Republican front-runner.\u201d\n\u201cIf Democrats are interested in holding on to the White House, if Democratic senators are interested in regaining a majority in the Senate and picking up seats in the House and statehouses all across the county, Bernie\u2019s the best bet,\u201d Briggs said.\nEven so, Democrats privately believe Sanders is already calculating how to gradually shift toward a posture of unity by summertime. With Clinton favored to win the nomination and beat Trump in the general election, Sanders also has to think about his relationship with a potential future president and returning to the Senate, where he caucuses with Democrats.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t do it,\u201d said one high-ranking Democratic staffer on Capitol Hill of Sanders continuing to attack Clinton in ways that go beyond their policy differences.\nSen. Mark Kirk to GOP colleagues: 'Man up and cast a vote' By Nick Gass\nAt the same time, Democrats need to tread carefully in how they treat Sanders. His legion of followers will be critical to getting Clinton elected, not to mention scores of Democratic Senate and House candidates. It\u2019s unknown how hard Sanders would campaign for Clinton, assuming she does prevail.\n\u201cI think that Sen. Sanders has built a movement. And that whatever happens, the two big tribes of the Democratic Party will be able to unite at the convention and be so much stronger,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).\nBut the dance is sure to be awkward. Not a single Democratic senator has endorsed Sanders. And beneath their deference, there\u2019s growing irritation among the lawmakers that the longer his campaign continues, the more he will undermine Clinton in the fall.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something he\u2019s going to have to decide,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said of how long Sanders remains in the race. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be the nominee.\u201d\nBut, for now at least, Democrats believe measured diplomacy is the best approach for dealing with Sanders and his supporters.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any Democrat should call on him to get out,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). \u201cAlmost no Democrat I know would say that. And shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Photo Essay The Hipsters of Havana With their tattoos, skateboards, and tech degrees, the country's millennials are untethered from the communist ideals of the past and ready to meet the world. By Edu Bayer Alhen Mayfren and Belkys Mata pose for a picture at Pabell\u00f3n Cuba. She is an accountant from Venezuela and came to Cuba on vacation for a couple of weeks. Mayfren is dancer and actor, and he is currently preparing a street show in Old Havana for the \"Habana Vieja: Ciudad en Movimiento\" festival. A view of downtown Vedado district from the roof of the Prince building. In the background is the Hotel Habana Libre, the former Hilton Hotel before the Cuban revolution. A teenaged couple at the Malec\u00f3n, an esplanade that runs for a five-mile stretch along the coast of Havana. A popular spot, this balcony to the sea offers relief from the noisy city. Concrete Soviet-style building in Alamar, a Havana suburb, that was converted into the Centro de Arte de Alamar, Habana del Este. Alamar, developed in the 1970s with the help of the former Soviet Union, is one of the biggest housing projects in Cuba and is now in decay. Alamar is also seen by many as the birthplace of Cuban hip hop. Twenty-two-year-old Shellys Mayara is a second-year student at the ISA (Instituto Superior de Arte), but she also works as an actress and model. \"I am lucky to be very busy working as an actress, makeup artist, and model.\" She says she\u2019s going to take part in a U.S.-Mexican horror movie, soon to be filmed at the border. A group of kids has come to the Malec\u00f3n after an afternoon of street soccer. Hot, they abandoned their game to jump into the cool water, when a guard came to fine them. For years, it has been forbidden to swim in the Malec\u00f3n. The authorities do not permit it because of the water pollution and the risks of swimming near the reefs and rocks. Harlyn Ramos, 26, is a jazz, fusion, and Cuban music percussionist. A native of Havana, he grew up in the neighborhood of La Ceiba. Now, he lives in St. Petersburg, Russia, with his wife but is back in Cuba to see his family. He carries his iPhone in his pocket, a luxury few of his Cuban friends can afford. Damarys Benavides consoles her friend, Claudia, who is having problems with her boyfriend, at the entrance of Pabell\u00f3n Cuba, one of the most important spots in the youth culture scene; it is the only place where there are free concerts every day, and youngsters go to drink coffee, sodas, beers, and rum. Cristobal, 22, is graduate of fine arts and is now working as a tattoo artist in Pinar del R\u00edo. Though the practice is still largely illegal, making it difficult to import the necessary equipment (needles, sterilizers, and ink), the fondness for tattoos is growing. Recent reforms have not formally legalized the activity, although the first official tattoo studio recently opened and is attached to an urban art gallery in Havana. Kids line up at the legendary ice-cream parlor, Coppelia, known as the \u201cice-cream cathedral.\u201d A project of the communist government, it was built in 1966 in the city center of Havana. Its advent was marked by whimsy and splendor, offering 26 flavors of ice cream. Today, due to a shortage of products, Coppelia only serves one flavor a day, but still thousands of people come every day, waiting upwards of two hours in line. A scoop of ice cream costs 2 Cuban pesos (8 cents USD). Monica Molt\u00f3, a telecommunications student in Havana, at a cafe trying to connect to the Internet. Empty rum bottles. Traces of last night at the Malec\u00f3n in the morning. This is a popular place that in the afternoon, evening, and night is filled with couples and groups of friends having fun. There are all sorts of stories, always accompanied by rum, beer, and cigarettes. Ernesto Mesa, 21, a visual artist from Guanabacoa, is part of a skater groupfrom Paseo Prado. He no longer owns his own skateboard, but he keeps going out every day with his gang. A self-taught, aspiring artist, Mesa would love to pursue an art history degree. Though both his parents have jobs, they don\u2019t have the money to spend on tuition. \u201cI love doing stencils,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I cannot afford the sprays.\u201d A fan of American music, his hairstyle is a tribute to Jimi Hendrix. Young people enjoy beers at Pabell\u00f3n Cuba. The price of a beer in a Havana bar ranges from $1 to $2.50. Pabell\u00f3n Cuba is an important place in Cuba\u2019s youth culture scene. In the afternoon and into early evening, there is a small bar that serves coffee and drinks, and bands play music. William Montano is a new cuentapropista (an entrepreneur), selling telephone cards in Vedado. The 27-year-old used to be a fisherman, but now he works full time with his new business. He still fishes on Sundays at the Malec\u00f3n. In addition to the money he makes with phones, he sells his weekly catch -- 4 to 6 pounds of fish. A common scene in Cuba: men playing Parcheesi on a street in downtown Havana. Domino and Parcheesi have been the most popular games in the neighborhoods of Havana. The youth of today are exchanging those habits for video games and mobiles. Javier Marine, 20, is one of three guards who watch over the new headquarters of the French Lyceum school in central Havana, inaugurated last month by the president of France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. \u201cThank God I have not had problems, because Cubans are not problematic at all,\u201d Marine says referring to the relative lack of violence in Cuba. He hopes to someday study computer science. The first free Wi-Fi Internet in Cuba, at the Kcho art studio in El Romerillo. Dozens of young people came with their computers and phones to connect, but the network was saturated with users, and no one was able to connect. Fabian Lopez is the 18-year-old leader of the skater group from Paseo Prado. He studied English and makes his living mostly as a tattoo artist. \u201cHavana is very good for skating,\u201d he says. But the police often get in the way. \u201cI have about 50 pending fines of 100 Cuban pesos ($4) each, but I do not have the money.... They all are fines for skating under the law of social indiscipline.\u201d He acknowledges that the skill level is not as high here in Cuba as it is elsewhere in the global skating community. But, he says, \u201cI do not say that because I dislike my country, in fact, I have this island on my arm,\u201d he says, holding up his arm to reveal it. \u201cIt was my first tattoo.\u201d David Perez Laza, 40, Leo Canosa, 40, and Mauro Coca, 23, are tattoo artists at La Marca, which opened in January 2015. This business was not possible a short time ago. \nMonica Molt\u00f3 sits on a small boat-shaped brick bench, the work of artist Alexis Leyva Machado, known as Kcho. The people scattered around her are busy with their laptops, tablets, and computers. She is one of the dozens of young people patiently trying to connect to the first free Wi-Fi Internet in Cuba at the Kcho art studio in El Romerillo. \nMolt\u00f3, 18, is a telecommunications student in Havana. \n\u201cIn college, we fix payphones and old machines,\u201d Molt\u00f3 says as she holds an iPhone in one hand and checks her laptop with the other. Sporting a tight printed T-shirt and big retro sunglasses, Molt\u00f3 wears her dyed hair short and has a small piercing in her nose. Referring to school, she says that much of the work they do \u201cis all very theoretical, because we have very few computers and almost no Internet.\u201d \nAfter a half hour, Molt\u00f3 gives up on trying to load her Facebook page, though the rest of the young faces around her still appear engrossed in their browser screens waiting to connect. They, like Molt\u00f3, are part of Cuba\u2019s millennial generation, a group of young people who no longer identify with their country\u2019s revolutionary ideology. They are not as vested in politics nor are they interested in working for the state for a monthly wage of roughly $15 to $20. \nMolt\u00f3 was 11 years old when Fidel Castro resigned power, and she does not remember his now notoriously long speeches, in which he railed against the United States and harangued the Cuban people listening with his ideas about socialism. Neither does she remember Cuba\u2019s links to the USSR, the hard Per\u00edodo Especial, and when the famous Coppelia ice-cream shop had more than one flavor per day. The Cuban revolution is something that she studied in school and is little more than that to her now -- something that happened long ago. It is not a part of her. \nNowadays, however, in her Cuba -- despite most of the population still working for the state -- the biggest part of the people\u2019s salary is the black market, especially in the cities. The system doesn\u2019t work anymore. There is a funny sentence that many people like to repeat: \u201cThe state pretends to pay us, and we pretend to work.\u201d \nShe is part of a growing and ambitious creative collective -- young musicians, designers, dancers, actors, and artists -- who lack material wealth but are now seeking their place in the alternative (private) scene outside the official proceedings. \nCuban millenials have a more Western mentality; they want stuff, they want to look good, to have fun, and to be able to have the freedom to pursue grander ambitions -- financial and otherwise. \nThey want more.

      "text": "As Cuba Rises, Puerto Rico Falls 8 By James Gibney \nPresident Barack Obama dangles U.S. dollars before the Castros while Congress stonewalls Puerto Rico\u2019s pleas for debt restructuring. The Tampa Bay Rays take the field in Havana as San Juan fends off New York hedge funds wielding legal baseball bats. The Rolling Stones play a free concert for Cubans; Puerto Rico can\u2019t get no satisfaction. \nAs Cuba rises and Puerto Rico falls, it\u2019s worth considering the diverging trajectories of these two ex-Spanish colonies that the Puerto Rican poet Lola Rodr\u00edguez de Ti\u00f3 described more than 100 years ago as \u201ctwo wings of the same bird.\u201d Even as the resumption of diplomatic ties with the U.S. opens new possibilities for Cuba, Puerto Rico\u2019s current status as a U.S. commonwealth has turned into an ugly dead end. \nPuerto Rico is defaulting in slow motion on $70 billion worth of debt. Its economy has shrunk 9 of the past 10 years. A few hundred miles to the west, meanwhile, economic reforms are creating new livelihoods for self-employed Cubans, whose material conditions are improving. Buoyed by the arrival of new tourists, remittances, and foreign investments , Cuba\u2019s economy grew by 4 percent last year. \nAnd when the U.S. embargo is lifted, Cuba \u2013 which for much of the 19 th and 20 th centuries was the Caribbean\u2019s predominant economy -- is likely to take a growing bite out of Puerto Rico\u2019s fortunes, in tourism , manufacturing and services. And that's before accounting for Puerto Rico's existing fiscal straits, which will lead to shrinking government services, higher costs imposed by utilities under siege from creditors and a string of broken social promises and busted pensions. \nTrue, Cubans don\u2019t have democracy. Then again, at the national level, neither do Puerto Ricans: Despite being U.S. citizens, they can't vote for president or in Congress, which these days mostly ignores them. Cubans may face the threat of arbitrary detention and abuse. But they\u2019re much less likely than Puerto Ricans to be shot dead on the street, or to be victimized by drug traffickers or other criminals. \nIn fact, by many other yardsticks, you\u2019re better off being born in Cuba than Puerto Rico. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at the World Factbook put out by those raving socialists at the Central Intelligence Agency. Lower infant mortality? Check! Same with lower unemployment, higher literacy, and a lower overall death rate. \nThings weren\u2019t supposed to turn out this way for the island that President John F. Kennedy touted three months after the Bay of Pigs invasion as \u201ca source of hope and inspiration to those of us deeply concerned with charting new courses of social progress for our Hemisphere.\u201d \nPuerto Rico's Slide \nThe proximate cause of Puerto Rico\u2019s current distress is its crushing debt, which has tripled since 2000. And yes, irresponsible and corrupt legislators and executives (and the voters who elect them) deserve much of the blame. \nBut the larger problem has been Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with its federal overlords, who have oscillated between patronizing micromanagement and malign neglect -- devising ill-suited development strategies, granting and then revoking economic benefits, imposing regulations that undermined the island\u2019s competitiveness and creating disincentives for work. \nConsider the Washington-backed effort to turn Puerto Rico into a manufacturing hub. During the late 1940s, U.S. companies were given federal and local tax breaks to locate on the island. But U.S. minimum wage laws and trade agreements with other nations gradually eroded Puerto Rico's competitive advantages. Moreover, instead of investing in the island, U.S. companies brought their profits back to the mainland. \nIn 1976, the U.S. tried again, sweetening the pot for companies with Section 936 of the Federal Tax Reform Act. That created new jobs in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and electronics, but at huge fiscal cost as mainland corporations gamed tax laws. When the U.S. phased out the tax breaks, the island's manufacturing employment took a big hit -- a blow that Puerto Rico's legislators are quick to blame for the island's decline, not least because it conveniently absolves them for their own bad decisions. \nThe Republican-controlled U.S. Congress is now debating what to do about Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal mess. The island's top officials have all but begged for the ability to restructure the debt of its municipalities under Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code \u2013 a power Puerto Rico had for decades until Congress took it away . Better yet would be the ability also to restructure its general obligation debt, which it can\u2019t realistically pay. \nCongress seems unlikely to allow restructuring. Instead, the Republican majority wants to impose a fiscal control board that takes over Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs. Analysts at Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for a New Economy have argued against this approach's \"colonial and imperialistic overtones,\" which also contradict the GOP's devolutionary, small-government philosophy. Instead, they advocate passing a \"fiscal responsibility law\" with strict enforcement provisions. \nAs smart as this idea looks on paper, the island\u2019s repeated failures to put its own fiscal house in order undermine that case. On the other hand, imposing a control board without granting debt relief risks accelerating Puerto Rico\u2019s downward spiral. \nThat brings us back to the central question of Puerto Rico\u2019s sovereignty. A control board for Puerto Rico would be all-too-consistent with its quasi-colonial status: Its legislators and executives behave irresponsibly in part because the buck doesn't stop with them. The island depends on the federal government for a quarter of its revenues, on terms that Washington sets, while it's straightjacketed by federal regulations that hurt its competitiveness and estrange it from neighboring economies. \nMaking Puerto Rico a state wouldn't necessarily cure it of bad fiscal behavior (see: Illinois). And independence would bring huge challenges. But remaining a commonwealth isn't working either. More than a half-century after JFK called Puerto Rico a \"source of hope and inspiration,\" its predicament should be a source of shame for every American. Its U.S. citizens have rates of poverty and unemployment that dwarf those on the mainland, and diminishing prospects that make a mock of the American Dream. They don't even enjoy the full benefits of the U.S. Constitution. \nTheir lot won't fundamentally improve until they seize control of their own destiny and choose between statehood or independence. And when they finally make that choice, Congress should honor it, either welcoming Puerto Rico as the 51 st state or allowing it to be independent. \nOnce Cuba gained its independence from U.S. control in 1902, it became theoretically free to make its own mistakes, notwithstanding the colossus to the north looking over its shoulder. And Lord knows Cuba made plenty of them, even before its current detour through socialist privation and repression. Over the years, Cuba has nonetheless delighted in tweaking Uncle Sam in the United Nations over Puerto Rico\u2019s \"colonial\" status, and is doubtless enjoying some quiet schadenfreude over its neighbor's troubles. \nYet these two islands can lift each other up. In addition to their shared history and culture, they face some similar demographic and economic challenges, and have some complementary strengths -- Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry and Cuba's nascent biotechnology sector, for instance. An unlikely partnership, perhaps. But as President Obama has noted about Cuban policy, we know what hasn't worked. Maybe it's time to try something different for Puerto Rico too.

      "text": "Who's winning, who's losing, and why. March 21 2016 5:46 PM Hillary Clinton\u2019s AIPAC Speech Was a Symphony of Craven, Delusional Pandering Clinton had an opportunity to show some political courage. She decided to alienate the left instead. Democratic Presidential hopeful former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks at the AIPAC conference in Washington, D.C., March 21, 2016. Saul Loeb/Getty Images \nAny presidential candidate speaking to AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, during an election year is going to bow to the hawkish elements of the Israel lobby. Hillary Clinton\u2019s keynote speech at AIPAC\u2019s annual meeting Monday, however, was more debased than it needed to be, promising that under her administration, Israel will be spared even the mild rebukes it has suffered under President Obama. A symphony of pandering, it attempted to outflank Donald Trump on the right and will end up outraging a large chunk of the left. Michelle Goldberg \nMichelle Goldberg is a columnist for Slate and the author, most recently, of The Goddess Pose . \nAs Joe Biden acknowledged in his AIPAC speech on Sunday, Israel\u2019s \u201csteady and systematic process of expanding settlements, legalizing outposts, seizing land\u201d is making a two-state solution impossible. The settlements are pushing Israel toward a one-state reality, in which Jews rule over the Arabs with whom they are geographically intermingled. Clinton\u2019s speech, however, barely nodded toward this reality, and when it did, it was with a promise to protect Israel from the consequences of flouting international law. Advertisement \nHere is the entirety of Clinton\u2019s remarks about settlements: \u201cEveryone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts. And as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear\u2014I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.\u201d \nShe spent significantly more time railing against the \u201calarming\u201d Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement , which is gaining traction on college campuses nationwide. Pledging to \u201ctake our alliance to the next level,\u201d Clinton said that one of the first things she\u2019d do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to the White House. That was a barely veiled rebuke to Obama, who never treated Benjamin Netanyahu with the deference the prime minister felt entitled to. Before the speech, some had hoped that Clinton might offer a word of solidarity or encouragement to beleaguered progressives in Israel. She gave them nothing. \nIt\u2019s understandable that Clinton would want to widen the gulf between AIPAC and Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee. \u201cWe need steady hands, not a president who says he\u2019s neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because everything is negotiable,\u201d she said to applause, out-hawking the man who is running on a platform of Middle Eastern war crimes. In doing so, she offered a bridge to #NeverTrump neoconservatives like Max Boot and Robert Kagan, who has already written that, should Trump be the nominee, \u201cthe only choice will be to vote for Hillary Clinton. The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be.\u201d \nAnti-Trump neoconservatives, however, are a miniscule group of people. And in seeking their approval, Clinton has further alienated left-wing voters, particularly young ones. Polls show that Americans under 30 are far more critical of Israel than are older voters. Liberal Democrats sympathize more with the Palestinians than they do with Israel. There is already deep suspicion of Clinton\u2019s foreign-policy instincts among Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters; Clinton doesn\u2019t need to give them new reasons to distrust her. \nThis year of all years, Clinton could have afforded to show a bit of courage before AIPAC. Jews will vote Democratic no matter what. Sixty-nine percent of them voted for Obama in 2012, despite the well-known tension between him and Netanyahu. Unlike Obama, Clinton is going to be running against a demagogue with German roots who plays footsie with white supremacists and reportedly kept a volume of Hitler\u2019s speeches beside his bed. She\u2019ll have all the Jewish support she needs without sucking up to the Likud. \nSo why is she doing it? Her correspondence with adviser Sid Blumenthal\u2014a man loathed by the Israel lobby for not disavowing his anti-Zionist son, Max\u2014suggests that she\u2019s aware of the damage Netanyahu is doing to the cause of peace in the Middle East. But if she is, she doesn\u2019t care about it enough to take even a tiny political risk, to tell a crowd something other than exactly what it wants to hear. Either Clinton\u2019s AIPAC speech was driven by belief, or it was driven by cynicism. It\u2019s hard to say which is worse. ",

      "text": "By Post Opinions Staff March 21 at 6:04 PM Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump visited the editorial board of The Washington Post on Mar. 21. Here is audio of the full, unedited interview. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) FREDERICK RYAN JR., WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER: Mr. Trump, welcome to the Washington Post. Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board.\nDONALD TRUMP: New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it.\nRYAN: Thank you\u2026 We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly\u2026 Any you can share with us?\nTRUMP: Well, I hadn\u2019t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names\u2026 Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he\u2019s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that\u2019s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that\u2019s a representative group.\nFRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Do you want to start out?\nTRUMP: No, other than to say, we\u2019re working hard, I think we\u2019re all in the same business of trying to make our country better, a better place, so we have something in common. I\u2019ve been treated very, very badly by The Washington Post, but, you know, I guess \u2014 and I\u2019m your neighbor, I\u2019m your neighbor right down the road, in fact we\u2019re actually giving a press conference there in a little while, I think your people are going to be there. And by the way, Bob Costa is an excellent reporter, I\u2019ve found him to be just an excellent reporter. I should tell you, because I have to give you the good and the bad. Not that he does me any favors, because he doesn\u2019t, but he\u2019s a real professional.\nSo we\u2019re having a news conference today in the new building that\u2019s going up, and the building is very much ahead of schedule, because it was supposed to open two years from September, and we\u2019re going to open it in September. We could open it actually sooner but we\u2019re going to break it in a little bit, so we\u2019re going to open it in September, and it\u2019s under budget, even though we\u2019ve increased the quality of the finishes substantially, marble finishes, very high quality of marble, so we\u2019re under budget and ahead of schedule. And I\u2019m, you know, I am that way when I build, I know how to build, I know how to get things done.\nThe GSA [General Services Administration], I will say, GSA has been very professional, they\u2019ve been very, very professional. They chose us over\u2014I think they had more than 100 people who bid, you can imagine, because of the location, but they had over 100 people that bid, and it was broken down into ten finalists, and I got it. We got it because of the strength of my financial statement and also because of the strength of what we were proposing. So we\u2019re having a news conference there today. What time is that, Hope?\nHOPE HICKS, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON: It\u2019s at 2:15.\nTRUMP: 2:15. I hear a lot of the press is going to be there, we\u2019re going to give them a tour of the building. It\u2019s still a little bit rough \u2014 as an example, a lot of the marble surfaces all have sheetrock covering, and plywood covering on them, so a lot of people won\u2019t see as much as they think. It\u2019ll be like a miracle, you take it off and it explodes, like it\u2019s finished, right? But that\u2019ll be a fun news conference.\nHIATT: If I could, I\u2019d start by asking is there a secretary of state and a secretary of defense in the modern era who you think have done a good job? Who do you think were the best?\nTRUMP: Well, because I know so many of them, and because in many cases I like them, I hate to get totally involved. I think George Shultz was very good, I thought he was excellent. I can tell you, I think your last secretary of state and your current secretary of state have not done much. I think John Kerry\u2019s deal with Iran is one of the worst things that I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated of any kind. It\u2019s just a horrible giveaway.\nHIATT: What in particular?\nTRUMP: Well, I think, number one, we shouldn\u2019t have given the money back. I think, number two, we should have had our prisoners before the negotiations started. We should have doubled up the sanctions. We should have gone in and said, \u2018release our prisoners,\u2019 they would have said \u2018no,\u2019 and we would have said, \u2018double up the sanctions,\u2019 and within a short period of time we would have had our prisoners back. And I think that was a terrible mistake. I think giving the money back was a terrible mistake. And by the way they are not using the money on us, they are not buying anything from us, they\u2019re buying, you noticed, they didn\u2019t buy Boeing, they bought Airbus, 118 planes from what I understand, but they bought them all from Airbus, they go out of their way not to spend any money in our country. So I wouldn\u2019t have done that. And I think it\u2019s going to just lead, actually, to nuclear problems. I also think it\u2019s going to be bad for Israel. It\u2019s a very bad deal for Israel.\nHIATT: George Shultz, it\u2019s interesting, was associated with a foreign policy of Reagan that was very much devoted to promoting democracy and freedom overseas. Is that something you think in today\u2019s world the United States should be doing?\nTRUMP: I do think it\u2019s a different world today and I don\u2019t think we should be nation building anymore. I think it\u2019s proven not to work. And we have a different country than we did then. You know we have 19 trillion dollars in debt. We\u2019re sitting probably on a bubble and, you know, it\u2019s a bubble that if it breaks is going to be very nasty. And I just think we have to rebuild our country. If you look at the infrastructure \u2014 I just landed at an airport where, not in good shape, not in good shape. If you go to Qatar and if you go to (inaudible) you see airports the likes of which you have never seen before. Dubai, different places in China. You see infrastructure, you see airports, other things, the likes of which you have never seen here.\nHIATT: Short of nation building, is there any role in promoting values or democracy? Or that\u2019s not something\u2026\nTRUMP: Well, there is, I just think that we have values in our country that we have to promote. We have a country that is in bad shape, it\u2019s in bad condition. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a horrible mess. I watched Baltimore, I have many, many friends in Baltimore, we watched what happened. St. Louis, Ferguson, Oakland, it could have been much worse over the summer. And it will probably be worse this summer. But you look at some of our inner cities. And yet you know I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they\u2019d be blown up. And we\u2019d build another one and it would get blown up. And we would rebuild it three times. And yet we can\u2019t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can\u2019t build in our own country. And at what point do you say hey, we have to take care of ourselves. So, you know, I know the outer world exists and I\u2019ll be very cognizant of that but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially in the inner cities.\nHIATT: So what would you do for Baltimore, let\u2019s say.\nTRUMP: Well, number one, I\u2019d create economic zones. I\u2019d create incentives for companies to move in. I\u2019d work on spirit because the spirit is so low, it\u2019s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African American youth, is 58-59 percent. It\u2019s unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans \u2013 not youth, but African Americans \u2013 is very high. And I would create in the inner cities, which is what I really do best, that\u2019s why when I open a building and I show you it\u2019s way ahead of schedule, under budget and everything else\u2014I think it was the Rite Aid store, the store in Baltimore it took them 20 years to get it built, one store, and then it burned down in one night\u2014we have to create incentives for people to love what they are doing, and to make money. And to create, you know, to really create a better life for themselves. And you can\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem right that you will have a situation like Baltimore, and many other places, let\u2019s use Baltimore as an example, there are many Baltimores in this country. Detroit is maybe even a better example than Baltimore. But that you\u2019ll have a situation like that, and then we\u2019re over nation building with other, with countries that in many cases don\u2019t want us there. They want our money, but they don\u2019t want us.\nHIATT: The root of many people\u2019s unhappiness in Baltimore was the perception that blacks are treated differently by law enforcement. And the disproportionate \u2013 do you think it\u2019s a problem that the percentage of blacks in prison is higher than whites, and what do you think is the root of that situation?\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019ve never really see anything that \u2013 you know, I feel very strongly about law enforcement. And, you know, if you look at the riot that took place over the summer, if that were stopped \u2013 it all, it mostly took place on the first evening, and if that were stopped on the first evening, you know, you\u2019d have a much nicer city right now, because much of that damage and much of the destruction was done on Evening One. So I feel that law enforcement, it\u2019s got to play a big role. It\u2019s got to play a big role. But that\u2019s a pretty good example, because tremendous amounts of damage was done that first evening \u2013 first two evenings, but the first evening in particular. And so I\u2019m a very strong believer in law enforcement, but I\u2019m also a very strong believer that the inner cities can come back.\nHIATT: Do you see any racial disparities in law enforcement \u2013 I mean, what set it off was the Freddie Gray killing, as you know. Is that an issue that concerns you?\nTRUMP: Well, look, I mean, I have to see what happens with the trial. I\u2014\nHIATT: Well, forget Freddie Gray, but in general, do you believe there are disparities in law enforcement?\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve read where there are and I\u2019ve read where there aren\u2019t. I mean, I\u2019ve read both. And, you know, I have no opinion on that. Because frankly, what I\u2019m saying is you know we have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people to work. And you know we have lost million and millions of jobs to China and other countries. And they\u2019ve been taken out of this country, and when I say millions, you know it\u2019s, it\u2019s tremendous. I\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs, I\u2019ve seen numbers that range from 6 million to, to smaller numbers. But it\u2019s many millions of jobs, and it\u2019s to countries all over. Mexico is really becoming the new China. And I have great issue with that. Because you know I use in speeches sometimes Ford or sometimes I use Carrier \u2013 it\u2019s all the same: Ford, Carrier, Nabisco, so many of the companies \u2014 they\u2019re moving to Mexico now. And you know we shouldn\u2019t be allowing that to happen. And tremendous unemployment, tremendous. They\u2019re allowing tremendous people that have worked for the companies for a long time, they\u2019re allowing, if they want to move around and they want to work on incentives within the United States, that\u2019s one thing, but when they take these companies out of the United States. Other countries are outsmarting us by giving them advantages, you know, like in the case of Mexico. In the case of many other countries. Like Ireland is, you\u2019re losing Pfizer to Ireland, a great pharmaceutical company that with many, many jobs and it\u2019s going to move to Ireland.\nRUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST: But Mr. Trump, if I could just follow up on Fred\u2019s question. I think that what he was trying to get at was the anger in the African American community that held some of the riots and disturbances this summer about disparate treatment and about \u2026 clearly you say you\u2019ve read where there is disparate treatment. But it is pretty undeniable that there is disproportionate incarceration of African Americans vs. whites. What would you \u2013 is that something that concerns you?\nTRUMP: That would concern me, Ruth. It would concern me. But at the same time it can be solved to a large extant with jobs. You know, if we can rebuild those communities and create incentives for companies to move in and create jobs. Jobs are so important. There are no jobs. There are none. You go to those communities and you can\u2019t \u2013 there is nothing there. There is no incentive for people. It is a very sad situation. And what makes it even sadder is that we are spending so much money in other countries and our own country has vast pockets of poverty and a lot of this is caused by the fact that there are no jobs. So we can create jobs in places like Baltimore and Detroit. You know, Detroit made a move, but I don\u2019t know but it just seems to be fizzling. I don\u2019t know what is going on. I watched Detroit four, five years ago and it looked like they were really putting a full-court press on and it doesn\u2019t seem to be, from what I\u2019ve been told, friends of mine that are very much involved in that whole process that it doesn\u2019t seem to be, doesn\u2019t seem to be something that is being pursued like it should be pursued. But if we can create jobs, it will solve so many problems.\nCHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER/COLUMNIST: Can I follow up on that? I mean, to take the case of Baltimore, I mean one of the things that\u2019s so remarkable about Baltimore and Detroit is that both of these cities, like many others have been \u2013 it\u2019s not as if no one has ever said before we should have economic zones, it\u2019s not as if no one has ever said before we need incentives and taxes etc., etc. And Baltimore received a lot of federal aid over the years. So I guess the question, then, is what\u2019s different specifically about your approach to these issues from what\u2019s been tried in the past, because a lot of effort has been put in just the direction you just described.\nTRUMP: I think what\u2019s different is we have a very divided country. And whether we like it or not, it\u2019s divided as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it. I\u2018ve been, you know, I\u2019ve been doing things for a long time. I see it all the time. I mean I see it so often. I see it when we go out and we have 21,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona, the other day, the division \u2013 not so much Phoenix, because that was actually very smooth, there wasn\u2019t even a minor, they did block a road, but after that, that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division. You can see the division. There\u2019s a racial division that\u2019s incredible actually in the country. I think it\u2019s as bad, I mean you have to say it\u2019s as bad or almost as bad as it\u2019s ever been. And there\u2019s a lack of spirit. And one thing I thought that would happen, and it hasn\u2019t happened, unfortunately, I thought that President Obama would be a great cheerleader for the country. And it just hasn\u2019t happened. I mean we can say it has. But it hasn\u2019t happened. When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems. And you know there\u2019s a lack of spirit. I actually think I\u2019d be a great cheerleader \u2013 beyond other things, the other things that I\u2019d do \u2013 I actually think I\u2019d be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel it\u2019s a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit and that has not taken place. Just has not taken place.\nRYAN: Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve mentioned many times during the campaign, in fact including this morning, instances you feel where the press has been biased or unfair or outright false in their reporting, and you\u2019ve mentioned that you want to \u201copen up\u201d the libel laws. You\u2019ve said that several times.\nTRUMP: I might not have to, based on Gawker. Right?\n[CROSSTALK]\nTRUMP: That was an amazing\u2014\nRYAN: My question is not so much why you feel they should be open but how. What presidential powers and executive actions would you take to open up the libel laws?\nTRUMP: Okay, look, I\u2019ve had stories written about me \u2013 by your newspaper and by others \u2013 that are so false, that are written with such hatred \u2013 I\u2019m not a bad person. I\u2019m just doing my thing \u2013 I\u2019m, you know, running, I want to do something that\u2019s good. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know. This is a very difficult thing to do. In fact I\u2019ve always heard that if you\u2019re a very successful person you can\u2019t run for office. And I can understand that. You\u2019ll do a hundred deals, and you\u2019ll do one bad one or two bad ones \u2014 that\u2019s all they read about are the bad ones. They don\u2019t read about the one hundred and fifty great ones that you had. And even some of the ones they write that are good, they make them sound bad. You know, so I\u2019ve always heard that. I\u2019ve heard that if you\u2019re successful \u2013 very successful \u2013 you just can\u2019t run for\u2014\nRYAN: But how would you fix that? You\u2019ve said that you would open up the libel laws.\nTRUMP: What I would do, what I would do is I\u2019d \u2013 well right now the libel laws, I mean I must tell you that the Hulk Hogan thing was a tremendous shock to me because \u2013 not only the amount and the fact that he had the victory \u2014 because for the most part I think libel laws almost don\u2019t exist in this country, you know, based on, based on everything I\u2019ve seen and watched and everything else, and I just think that if a paper writes something wrong \u2014 media, when I say paper I\u2019m talking about media. I think that they can do a retraction if they\u2019re wrong. They should at least try to get it right. And if they don\u2019t do a retraction, they should, they should you know have a form of a trial. I don\u2019t want to impede free press, by the way. The last thing I would want to do is that. But I mean I can only speak for \u2013 I probably get more \u2013 do I, I mean, you would know, do I get more publicity than any human being on the earth? Okay? I mean, [ Editor\u2019s note: Trump points at Ruth Marcus ] she kills me, this one \u2013 that\u2019s okay, nice woman.\nRYAN: Would you expand, for example, prior restraints against publications?\nTRUMP: No, I would just say this. All I want is fairness. So unfair. I have stories and you have no recourse, you have no recourse whatsoever because the laws are really impotent.\nMARCUS: So in a better world would you be able to sue me?\nTRUMP: In a better world \u2014 no \u2014 in a better world I would be able to get a retraction or a correction. Not even a retraction, a correction.\nRYAN: Well, now, you\u2019ve been a plaintiff in libel suits so you know a little bit of the elements \u2026\nTRUMP: I had one basic big libel suit, it was a very bad system, it was New Jersey. I had a great judge, the first one, and I was going to win it. And then I had another good judge, the second one, and then they kept switching judges. And the third one was a bad judge. That\u2019s what happened. But, uh\u2026\nRYAN: But there\u2019s standards like malice is required. Would you weaken that? Would you require less than malice for news organizations?\nTRUMP: I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, yeah, I think I would get a little bit away from malice without having to get too totally away. Look, I think many of the stories about me are written badly. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s malice because the people don\u2019t know me. When Charles writes about me or when Ruth writes about me, you know, we\u2019ve never really met. And I get these stories and they\u2019re so angry and I actually say, I actually say, \u201cHow could they write?\u201d \u2013 and many stories I must tell you, many stories are written that with a brief phone call could be corrected before they\u2019re written. Nobody calls me.\nSTEPHEN STROMBERG, EDITORIAL WRITER: How are you defining \u201cincorrect?\u201d It seems like you\u2019re defining it as fairness or your view of fairness rather than accuracy.\nTRUMP: Fairness, fairness is, you know, part of the word. But you know, I\u2019ve had stories that are written that are absolutely incorrect. I\u2019ll tell you now and the word \u201cintent\u201d, as you know, is an important word, as you know, in libel. I\u2019ll give you an example. Some of the media, not all of it, but some of it, is very, very strong on \u2013 you know I get these massive crowds of people, and we\u2019ll get protesters. And these protesters are honestly, they\u2019re very bad people. In many cases, they\u2019re professionals. Highly trained professionals. And I will rent an arena for 20,000 seats and they will come in \u2013 because there\u2019s really no way \u2013 how you going to be able to tell \u2013 somebody said \u201coh you shouldn\u2019t let \u2018em in\u201d \u2013 how you gonna know, you know? They walk in. [Inaudible] So we had an incident this weekend, which was amazing in Tucson, Arizona where a man, a protestor, wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit, another one dragging an American flag, was walking out of the arena, and an African American man who was a supporter was sitting there listening to the speech and we had to stop because they were so loud \u2013 they\u2019re so loud, these people, I don\u2019t know what they do, they\u2019re trained voices or something. And they\u2019re walking up and you saw it, because it was all over television, and the African American man became incensed I think the guy said something to him like you know what, like \u201cscrew you,\u201d okay? Or worse. I think, because he looked over to him and said something to him and the guy just had it. Now, they were together, these two. The one wearing a Ku Klux Klan, the other dragging a flag or something, but the African American man, who I think was an Air Force person, I just read he had a pretty stellar life so far. And he just became incensed. So when I saw the television yesterday early in the morning I saw the Ku Klux Klan, I saw exactly what happened. By the time it got on to the national shows that was for the most part taken out. They just had this African American smacking, you know, fighting. And it didn\u2019t make sense, you know, why, why. But if you saw it in the morning it made a lot more sense. We don\u2019t condone violence at all but it\u2019s very, very unfair reporting and we, you know\u2026\nHIATT: Sorry, when you say we don\u2019t condone violence \u2014\nTRUMP: I say that.\nHIATT: You say that. But you\u2019ve also said, \u201cIn the good old days, he would have been ripped out of his seat so fast, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Isn\u2019t that condoning violence?\nTRUMP: No, because what I am referring to is, we\u2019ve had some very bad people come in. We had one guy \u2014 and I said it \u2014 he had the voice \u2014 and this was what I was referring to \u2014 and I said, \u201cBoy, I\u2019d like to smash him.\u201d You know, I said that. I\u2019d like to punch him. This guy was unbelievably loud. He had a voice like Pavarotti. I said if I was his manager I would have made a lot of money for him, because he had the best voice. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. And he was a swinger. He was hitting people. He was punching and swinging and screaming \u2014 you couldn\u2019t make \u2014 so you have to stop. You know, there is also something about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, \u201cscrew everybody.\u201d And that\u2019s when I made that statement. He was absolutely out \u2014 I mean, he hit people and he screamed and then he was walking out and he\u2019s giving everybody the finger. And they don\u2019t talk about that. See, they don\u2019t talk about that. They say, \u201cDonald, wait a second, Donald, don\u2019t\u201d \u2014\nHIATT: But your answer is you condone violence when the guy is really egregious and terrible?\nTRUMP: No, I condone strong law and order. I\u2019ll tell you what they \u2014\nHIATT: Rip him out of his seat, punch him in the face, isn\u2019t that violent?\nTRUMP: Well he punched other people.\nHIATT: No, I understand that.\nTRUMP: Fred, he punched other people. He was punching people. He was \u2014 one guy was, you know, I\u2019d like to say \u2014\nJO-ANN ARMAO, ASSOCIATE EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: The Fayetteville protester who was sucker punched \u2014 he didn\u2019t punch anyone \u2014\nTRUMP: No.\nARMAO: He was being escorted from police, and he was sucker punched.\nTRUMP: No. When are you talking about? When?\nARMAO: In Fayetteville.\nCOREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER [to Trump]: North Carolina.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know which one.\nARMAO: Yes you do.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. Because we\u2019ve had so many \u2014\nARMAO: That\u2019s the gentleman you said you were going to look into to see whether or not to pay his legal fees.\nTRUMP: Oh well that\u2019s a different \u2014 that\u2019s different from the one I\u2019m talking about. This one was about a month ago. This one was before Fayetteville.\nARMAO: Well, okay, Fayetteville, do you condone violence in that case \u2014\nTRUMP: No I don\u2019t, no I don\u2019t, that\u2019s different \u2014\nARMAO: Where the protester is being walked out \u2014\nTRUMP: By the way, that\u2019s different \u2014\nARMAO: But, yet, you explained it that he was giving the finger and so he provoked it, so he got sucker punched. And you are going to possibly pay for his legal expenses.\nTRUMP: He did give the finger, and \u2014\nARMAO: So that\u2019s okay?\nTRUMP: Well, a lot of people don\u2019t \u2014 you know, the finger means, \u201cF you.\u201d A lot of people think \u2014 and you have children there, you have a lot of children that go, you know, they go with their parents \u2014 a lot of people think that\u2019s very inappropriate. I mean, you know \u2014\nARMAO: It\u2019s certainly inappropriate.\nTRUMP: Well, I think it is.\nARMAO: But does it \u2014 is it \u2014 does it qualify to \u2014\nTRUMP: So do you let him \u2014\nARMAO: \u2014 to punch him in the face?\nTRUMP: Again I don\u2019t condone it. So do you let him walk out, he\u2019s holding up his finger, telling everybody. Same thing happened, you know, the last one in \u2014\nHIATT: I guess the question is, when you then offer to pay the guy\u2019s legal fees, isn\u2019t that \u2014\nTRUMP: I didn\u2019t offer \u2014\nHIATT: Isn\u2019t that condoning?\nTRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t offer, Fred \u2014\nHIATT: You said you would consider it \u2014\nTRUMP: I said I want to look into it. I said I want to look into it. I didn\u2019t say that.\nHIATT: Isn\u2019t that condoning?\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t think so.\nHIATT: Doesn\u2019t that convey a message of approval?\nTRUMP: Don\u2019t think so.\nLEWANDOWSKI: To be fair, before every event, there is a public service announcement made about \u2014\nTRUMP: It\u2019s true.\nLEWANDOWSKI: \u2014 any potential protesters. That is made to everybody that says \u2014\nTRUMP: Strong.\nLEWANDOWSKI: \u2014 please do not engage these protesters. You know, they may cause a disturbance. Please do your best, let local law enforcement handle this or security at that venue. The problem becomes, with a massive crowd of twenty or thirty or forty thousand people, the resources that are there don\u2019t have the ability to get to all these people in a manner before the crowd reacts, because the agitators are inciting those people. So we are very clear at the onset, that there is a loud public notice that says, \u201cplease do not engage these people, please let them do their job, and let the local law enforcement deal with that.\u201d That\u2019s said at the very front end at every event.\nTRUMP: Very loud, and it\u2019s repeated over and over. Actually, I guess it\u2019s on tape, but they repeat it over and over. One thing that was interesting this weekend. We had in Phoenix, Arizona, we had an interesting incident. We had people, we had a major highway coming into the arena. It\u2019s not an arena, it\u2019s a huge open space, 60 acres, and it was packed. And we had a major highway coming in, and people \u2014 protesters \u2014 stopped their car in the middle of the highway, chained themselves to their cars, and the cars \u2014 blocked. They were there for a while. A car was not able to move. They were backed up for 20 \u2014 I mean, like, just forever. And, it was terrible. And they were very abusive, screaming, you know, \u201cscrew you, screw you, pigs, pigs\u201d \u2014 meaning to the cops. Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 now that was his territory. Okay, he\u2019s a tough cookie. Sheriff Joe saw this, he gave them a couple of minutes to move their car \u2014 they didn\u2019t move them \u2014 cut the chains, arrested the people and just moved the cars over. I don\u2019t know how they did it \u2014 just, they were gone in minutes after he came there. Minutes. It was amazing how quick. They actually had chains around their necks. They didn\u2019t even know why they were there. People \u2013 somebody was interviewed, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d They didn\u2019t even know.\nNobody ever talks about these people. They say, \u201cOh, Trump had a bad rally,\u201d or something. You know there are two sides to it, and honestly, there is really one side of it \u2013 because you see how bad this was. So what happened is they arrested three people. There were probably a hundred or a hundred-fifty protesters, there were 21,000 people there, there were 150 protesters that were creating havoc. As soon as the three people were arrested, everybody else ran. That was the last we heard, and I made a speech for, you know, a half hour, 45 minutes \u2013 not one person stood up and started screaming at this speech. It was sort of an amazing thing.\nNow Tucson was different. Different police force, different level of, you know, whatever, and we had numerous interruptions during the speech. You know, I\u2019ll be speaking, I\u2019ll be ready to make a point, and a guy will stand up and start, just screaming. Out of \u2014 from nowhere, for, like, no reason. Not even screaming things that make sense, and often screaming tremendous obscenities.\nI know [Lewandowski] went in \u2013 he took a lot of heat a couple of days ago in that same rally because he went in to get \u2013 to quiet people down, and they had a couple of signs \u201cF-you\u201d \u2013 it just said \u201cF-you,\u201d meaning the word spelled out, and you have cameras there, you know, it\u2019s on live television, and you have guys holding signs saying \u201cF-you Trump\u201d or just \u201cF-you,\u201d and they had numerous of those \u2013 there were, you know, probably ten of those signs throughout the arena.\nAnd he went in to say, please would you move the sign, and the woman in front \u2013 and I saw it \u2013 this guy grabbed the woman in front, okay, he [Lewandowski] hardly touched him \u2013 he took him \u2013 If he touched him at all it was just grabbing the shirt a little bit. But the guy was a real wiseguy. And he was screaming obscenities. He did grab the woman in front and ultimately he was led out by the security guy, who was right behind him.\nBut the reason is that the police were slow to get there. And the point is this: You\u2019re making a speech and you have guys getting up saying, [ Editor\u2019s note: Trump says the next few words in a hushed voice ] \u201cfuck you,\u201d and the whole place goes, \u201cWhoa,\u201d and it incites the place. They incite the place, because then everyone goes, \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d That\u2019s why they\u2019re all screaming \u201cUSA, USA,\u201d or \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump.\u201d\nYou can have 20,000 people and you can have like two people. Usually \u2013 it\u2019s amazing \u2013 usually it\u2019s one person. I mean, it\u2019s like they stage it. It\u2019s very professional. They have like one person here, one person here, one person.\nOkay, we\u2019re talking about the media. So, I\u2019ve never seen the media cover it from that angle. It\u2019s always, \u201cTrump had a\u201d \u2014 and here\u2019s the big thing, I mean, honestly, essentially nobody has heard\nHIATT: But just \u2013 given the Supreme Court rulings on libel \u2014 Sullivan v. New York Times \u2014 how would you change the law?\nTRUMP: I would just loosen them up.\nRUTH MARCUS: What does that mean?\n[Crosstalk]\nTRUMP: I\u2019d have to get my lawyers in to tell you, but I would loosen them up. I would loosen them up. If The Washington Post writes badly about me \u2013 and they do, they don\u2019t write good \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t think I get \u2013 I read some of the stories coming up here, and I said to my staff, I said, \u201cWhy are we even wasting our time? The hatred is so enormous.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. I mean, I do a good job. I have thousands of employees. I work hard.\nI\u2019m not looking for bad for our country. I\u2019m a very rational person, I\u2019m a very sane person. I\u2019m not looking for bad. But I read articles by you, and others. And, you know, we\u2019ve never \u2013 we don\u2019t know each other, and the level of hatred is so incredible, I actually said, \u201cWhy am I \u2013 why am I doing this? Why am I even here?\u201d And I don\u2019t expect anything to happen\u2013\nRYAN: Would that be the standard then? If there is an article that you feel has hatred, or is bad, would that be the basis for libel?\nTRUMP: No, if it\u2019s wrong. If it\u2019s wrong.\nRYAN: Wrong whether there\u2019s malice or not?\nTRUMP: I mean, The Washington Post never calls me. I never had a call, \u201cWhy \u2013 why did you do this?\u201d or \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d It\u2019s just, you know, like I\u2019m this horrible human being. And I\u2019m not. You know, the one thing we have in common I think we all love the country. Now, maybe we come at it from different sides, but nobody ever calls me. I mean, Bob Costa calls about a political story \u2013 he called because we\u2019re meeting senators in a little while and congressmen, supporters \u2013 but nobody ever calls.\nRYAN: The reason I keep asking this is because you\u2019ve said three times you\u2019ve said we are going to open up the libel laws and when you ask you what you mean you say hatred, or bad\u2013\nTRUMP: I want to make it more fair from the side where I am, because things are said that are libelous, things are said about me that are so egregious and so wrong, and right now according to the libel laws I can do almost nothing about it because I\u2019m a well-known person you know, etc., etc.\nJACKSON DIEHL, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Back to foreign policy a little bit, can you talk a little bit about what you see as the future of NATO? Should it expand in any way?\nTRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have \u2013 I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they\u2019re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with \u2014 why are we always the one that\u2019s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I\u2019ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions\u2013 hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are.\nDIEHL: Hundreds of billions?\nTRUMP: Billions. Well if you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea \u2014 I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal. When you look at the kind of money that our country is losing, we can\u2019t afford to do this. Certainly we can\u2019t afford to do it anymore.\nDIEHL: About Ukraine, was it right for the United States to impose sanctions on Russia when they invaded Crimea and would you keep those sanctions on them?\nTRUMP: I think the answer is yes, it was, but I don\u2019t see other people doing much about it. I see us doing things about it, but I don\u2019t see other people doing much about it.\nDIEHL: And could I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30,000 troops and\u2014\nTRUMP: No I didn\u2019t, oh no no no, okay, I know what you\u2019re saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that 20- to 30,000. They said, would you send troops? I didn\u2019t say send 20,000. I said, well the generals are saying you\u2019d need because they , what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need 20- to 30,000 troops, but I didn\u2019t say that I would send them.\nDIEHL: If they said that, would you go along with that and send the troops?\nTRUMP: I find it hard to go along with\u2014I mention that as an example because it\u2019s so much. That\u2019s why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said did I say that and I said that that\u2019s a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and I\u2019d give them tremendous air supporters and support , because we have to get rid of ISIS, okay, just so \u2014 we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved.\nDIEHL: What about China and the South China Sea. What do you think they\u2019re up to and\u2014\nTRUMP: I think it\u2019s a terrible situation, I think it\u2019s terrible they have no respect for\u2013\nDIEHL: \u2013and what should we do about it?\nTRUMP: Well look, we have power over China and people don\u2019t realize it. We have trade power over China. I don\u2019t think we are going to start World War III over what they did, it affects other countries certainly a lot more than it affects us. But\u2014and honestly, you know part of\u2014I always say we have to be unpredictable. We\u2019re totally predictable. And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. I hate when they say \u2014 like I said get rid of the oil, keep the oil, different things over the years, when people are saying what would you do with regard to the Middle East, when we left \u2014 We should have never been in Iraq. It was a horr- it was one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. We then got out badly, then after we got out, I said, \u201cKeep the oil. If we don\u2019t keep it Iran\u2019s going to get it.\u201d And it turns out Iran and ISIS basically\u2014\nHIATT: How do you keep it without troops, how do you defend the oil?\nTRUMP: You would\u2026 You would, well for that\u2013 for that, I would circle it. I would defend those areas.\nHIATT: With U.S. troops?\nTRUMP: Yeah, I would defend the areas with the oil. And I would have taken out a lot of oil. And, uh, I would have kept it. I mean, I would have kept it, because, look: Iran has the oil, and they\u2019re going to have the oil, well, the stuff they don\u2019t have, because Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as you\u2019re sitting there. And I\u2019ve been very good on this stuff. My prognostications, my predictions have become, have been very accurate, if you look.\nHIATT: So what do you think China\u2019s aims are in the South China Sea?\nTRUMP: Well I know China very well, because I deal with China all the time. I\u2019ve done very well. China\u2019s unbelievably ambitious. China is, uh\u2026 I mean, when I deal with China, you know, I have the Bank of America building, I\u2019ve done some great deals with China. I do deals with them all the time on, you know, selling apartments, and, you know, people say \u2018oh that\u2019s not the same thing.\u2019 The level of\u2026 uh, the largest bank in the world, 400 million customers, is a tenant of mine in New York, in Manhattan. The biggest bank in China. The biggest bank in the world.\nChina has got unbelievable ambitions. China feels very invincible. We have rebuilt China. They have drained so much money out of our country that they\u2019ve rebuilt China. Without us, you wouldn\u2019t see the airports and the roadways and the bridges; I mean, the George Washington Bridge is like, that\u2019s like a trinket compared to the bridges that they\u2019ve built in China. We don\u2019t build anymore, and it, you know, we had our day. But China, if you look at what\u2019s going on in China, you know, they go down to seven percent or eight percent and it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. Our GDP is right now zero. Essentially zero.\nDIEHL: Could you use trade to cause them to retreat in the South China Sea?\nTRUMP: I think so, yeah. I think so\nDIEHL: What would you do?\nTRUMP: We, well, you start making it tougher. They\u2019re selling their products to us for\u2026 you know, with no tax, no nothing. By the way, we can\u2019t deal with them, but they can deal with us. See, we are free trade. The story is, and I have so many people that deal with China \u2013they can easily sell their product here. No tax, no nothing, just \u2018come on, bring it all in, you know, bring in your apples, bring in everything you make\u2019 and no taxes whatsoever, right? If you want to deal with China, it\u2019s just the opposite. You can\u2019t do that. In other words, if you want to, if you\u2019re a manufacturer, you want to go into China? It\u2019s very hard to get your product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax.\nHIATT: So, if they occupied what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, is that something the United States\u2026\nTRUMP: Well, I, you know, again, I don\u2019t like to tell you what I\u2019d do, because I don\u2019t want to\u2026 You understand what I\u2019m saying, Fred? If I\u2026 Okay, if I say \u2018Well, we should go in and do this or that or that,\u2019 I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to sort of\u2026 red flag all over it. I do think this: It\u2019s an unbelievable thing that they\u2019ve done, it\u2019s unbelievable aggression, it\u2019s unbelievable lack of respect for this country.\nHIATT: This theory of unpredictability, I want to push a little bit, I mean \u2013 there are many people who think that North Korea invaded South Korea precisely because Acheson wasn\u2019t clear that we would defend South Korea. So I\u2019m curious, does ambiguity sometimes have dangers?\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019ll give you, I\u2019ll give you an example. President Obama, when he left Iraq, gave a specific date \u2013 we\u2019re going to be out. I thought that was a terrible thing to do. And the enemy pulled back, because they don\u2019t want die. Despite what you read, you know, they don\u2019t want to die \u2014 and they just pulled back, and after we left, all hell broke out, right? And I\u2019ll give you another example that I think was terrible: when they sent, a few months ago, they sent fifty troops in. You know, fifty elite troops. Now, why do we have to have a news conference to announce that we\u2019re sending fifty troops? So those troops now have targets on their back. And\u2026you shouldn\u2019t do it. We\u2019re so predictable: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019re sending fifty troops into Iraq or Syria. And these are our elite troops. And they\u2019re going to do this and that and that and this.\u201d And those troops now are being hunted. If you didn\u2019t send them, they wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if you didn\u2019t say that, they wouldn\u2019t know. I mean, there are times when you just can\u2019t be\u2026 You talk too much. We talk too much. I guess they thought that was good politically, to say we\u2019re sending fifty troops? I don\u2019t think it was good.\nLANE: Can I ask you\u2026Just going back to NATO, because\u2026\nTRUMP: Yes.\nLANE: As you know, the whole theory of NATO from the beginning was to keep the United States involved in the long term in Europe to balance, to promote a balance of power in that region so we wouldn\u2019t have a repeat of World War I and World War 2. And it seems to be like what you\u2019re saying is very similar to what President Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg, in that we have allies that become free riders. So it seems like there\u2019s some convergence with the president there. What concerns me about both is that to some extent it was always thought to be in our interest that we, yes, we would take some of the burden on, yes, even if the net-net was not 100 percent, even steven, with the Germans. So I\u2019d like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries? Right, you\u2019ve painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense? Tell me more. Because it\u2019s not that you want to pull the U.S. out.\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We\u2019re not a rich country. We\u2019re borrowing, we\u2019re borrowing all of this money. We\u2019re borrowing money from China, which is a sort of an amazing situation. But things are a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we\u2019re protecting Europe but we\u2019re spending a lot of money. Number 1, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it. Obama has been stronger on the Ukraine than all the other countries put together, and those other countries right next door to the Ukraine. And I just say we have, I\u2019m not even knocking it, I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, we\u2019re not treated fair. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re treated fair, Charles, anywhere. If you look everything we have. You know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet we\u2019re not reimbursed fairly for what we do. We\u2019re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. We\u2019re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.\nLANE: You know, well, they say and I think this is on public record, it\u2019s basically 50 percent of the non-personnel cost is paid by South Korea and Japan.\nTRUMP: 50 percent?\nLANE: Yeah.\nTRUMP: Why isn\u2019t it 100 percent?\nHIATT: Well I guess the question is, does the United States gain anything by having bases?\nTRUMP: Personally I don\u2019t think so. I personally don\u2019t think so. Look. I have great relationships with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But that\u2019s a wealthy country. They make the ships, they make the televisions, they make the air conditioning. They make tremendous amounts of products. It\u2019s a huge, it\u2019s a massive industrial complex country. And \u2014\nHIATT: So you don\u2019t think the US gains from being the force that sort of that helps keep the peace in the Pacific?\nTRUMP: I think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we\u2019re a poor country now. We\u2019re a debtor nation. How you going to get rid \u2013 let me ask you \u2013 how are you going get rid of $21 trillion in debt? You\u2019re going to be at 21 trillion in a matter of minutes because of that new omnibus budget. So they passed that ridiculous omnibus budget. How you going to get rid of that debt. We\u2019re spending that to protect other countries. We\u2019re not spending it on ourselves. Because we have, we have armor-plated vehicles that are obsolete. The best ones are given to the enemy. We give them to our allies over in the Middle East. A bullet shot in the air and they immediately run and the enemy takes over. I have a friend whose son is in his third, his third tour over in Iraq. He\u2019s over in, I mean he\u2019s a very special kid, he\u2019s a great kid. But he\u2019s over in the Middle East, and, uh, Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East, actually. And he said to me, I said to him what do you think. And he said, it\u2019s so sad. He said the enemy has our equipment \u2013 the new version \u2014 and we have all the old version, and the enemy has our equipment, because they get into a fight with the so-called people like the Freedom Fighters, you know the whole Syrian deal, where we\u2019re sending billions and billions of dollars worth, and they capture the equipment. In most cases the shots are fired and everybody leaves. And these are the people we\u2019re backing. And we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be another Saddam Hussein deal, in other words, let\u2019s get rid of Assad with these people and these people end up being worse. Okay? But he said, they have better equipment. It\u2019s our equipment. They have, I guess we send 2,300 Humvees over, all armor-plated. So we have wounded warriors, with no legs, with no arms, because they were driving in stuff without the armor. And the enemy has most of the new ones we sent over that they captured. And he said, it\u2019s so discouraging when they see that the enemy has better equipment than we have \u2013 and it\u2019s our equipment.\nHIATT: I\u2019d like to come back to the campaign. You said a few weeks ago after a family in Chicago gave some money to a PAC opposing you, you said, \u201cThey better watch out. They have a lot to hide.\u201d What should they watch out for?\nTRUMP: Look, they are spending vicious \u2026 I don\u2019t even know these people. Those Ricketts. I actually said they ought to focus on the Chicago Cubs and, you know, stop playing around. They spent millions of dollars fighting me in Florida. And out of 68 counties, I won 66. I won by 20 points, almost 20 points. Against, everybody thought he was a popular sitting senator. I had $38 million dollars spent on me in Florida over a short period of time. $38 million. And, you know, the Ricketts, I don\u2019t even know these people.\nHIATT: So, what does it mean, \u201cThey better watch out\u201d?\nTRUMP: Well, it means that I\u2019ll start spending on them. I\u2019ll start taking ads telling them all what a rotten job they\u2019re doing with the Chicago Cubs. I mean, they are spending on me. I mean, so am I allowed to say that? I\u2019ll start doing ads about their baseball team. That it\u2019s not properly run or that they haven\u2019t done a good job in the brokerage business lately.\nRYAN: Would you do that while you are president?\nTRUMP: No, not while I am president. No, not while I\u2019m president. That is two phases. Right now, look, you know, I went to a great school, I was a good student and all. I am an intelligent person. My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at MIT for 35 years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else. Dr. John Trump, a great guy. I\u2019m an intelligent person. I understand what is going on. Right now, I had 17 people who started out. They are almost all gone. If I were going to do that in a different fashion I think I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. You would be interviewing somebody else. But it is hard to act presidential when you are being \u2026 I mean, actually I think it is presidential because it is winning. And winning is a pretty good thing for this country because we don\u2019t win any more. And I say it all the time. We do not win any more. This country doesn\u2019t win. We don\u2019t win with trade. We don\u2019t win with \u2026 We can\u2019t even beat ISIS. And by the way, just to answer the rest of that question, I would knock the hell out of ISIS in some form. I would rather not do it with our troops, you understand that. Very important. Because I think saying that is very important because I was against the war in Iraq, although they found a clip talking to Howard Stern, I said, \u201cWell\u2026\u201d It was very unenthusiastic. Before they want in, I was totally against the war. I was against it for years. I actually had a delegation sent from the White House to talk to me because I guess I get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I was just against the war. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it did. But we have to knock out ISIS. We are living like in medieval times. Who ever heard of the heads chopped off?\nHIATT: Just back to the campaign. You are smart and you went to a good school. Yet you are up there and talking about your hands and the size of private \u2026\nTRUMP: No \u2026\nHIATT: \u2026 your private parts.\nTRUMP: No, no. No, no. I am not doing that.\nHIATT: Do you regret having engaged in that?\nTRUMP: No, I had to do it. Look, this guy. Here\u2019s my hands. Now I have my hands, I hear, on the New Yorker, a picture of my hands.\nMARCUS: You\u2019re on the cover.\nTRUMP: A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They\u2019re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, \u201cOh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means.\u201d This was not me. This was Rubio that said, \u201cHe has small hands and you know what that means.\u201d Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later \u2026 and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, \u201cMr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands.\u201d And then another one would say, \u201cYou have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cI thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands.\u201d I had fifty people \u2026 Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, \u201cHow are Mr. Trump\u2019s hands?\u201d My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, \u201cOh, your hands are very nice. They are normal.\u201d So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say \u2026 now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn\u2019t work out. Obviously, it didn\u2019t work too well. But one of the things he said was \u201cHe has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else.\u201d You can look it up. I didn\u2019t say it.\nMARCUS: You chose to raise it \u2026\nTRUMP: No, I chose to respond.\nMARUS: You chose to respond.\nTRUMP: I had no choice.\nMARCUS: You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I\u2019m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me \u2026 every time I\u2019d shake people\u2019s hand, \u201cOh, you have nice hands.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions \u2026 I even held up my hands, and said, \u201cLook, take a look at that hand.\u201d\nMARCUS: You told us in the debate \u2026.\nTRUMP: And by saying that, I solved the problem. Nobody questions. Everyone held my hand. I said look. Take a look at that hand.\nMARCUS: You told us in the debate that you guaranteed there was not another problem. Was that presidential? And why did you decide to do that?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, \u2018Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the\u2013 a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can\u2019t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I\u2019ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think it\u2019s not a question of presidential \u2026\nMARCUS: He said he regrets \u2026\nHIATT: Okay, let\u2019s move on here. Let\u2019s move on.\nTRUMP: I did feel I should respond. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But I felt I should respond because everybody was talking about it.\nRYAN: You [MUFFLED] mentioned a few minutes earlier here that you would knock ISIS. You\u2019ve mentioned it many times. You\u2019ve also mentioned the risk of putting American troop in a danger area. If you could substantially reduce the risk of harm to ground troops, would you use a battlefield nuclear weapon to take out ISIS?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want to use, I don\u2019t want to start the process of nuclear. Remember the one thing that everybody has said, I\u2019m a counterpuncher. Rubio hit me. Bush hit me. When I said low energy, he\u2019s a low-energy individual, he hit me first. I spent, by the way he spent 18 million dollars\u2019 worth of negative ads on me. That\u2019s putting [MUFFLED]\u2026\nRYAN: This is about ISIS. You would not use a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS?\n[CROSSTALK]\nTRUMP: I\u2019ll tell you one thing, this is a very good looking group of people here. Could I just go around so I know who the hell I\u2019m talking to?\nHIATT: Sure, then I\u2019d like to let a couple of them get in questions.\nLEWANDOWSKI: We have got five minutes, hard out.\nHIATT: Okay.\nTRUMP: Oh is it?\nCORY: Yeah. You have a meeting you have to get to.\nTRUMP: Okay we do.\nARMAO: I\u2019m Jo-Ann Armao. I cover D.C. events. I want to ask you a question about what you think about D.C. voting rights or statehood.\nTRUMP: Okay. I\u2019ll talk about that.\nTOM TOLES, EDITORIAL CARTOONIST: Tom Toles.\nTRUMP: Hi, Tom.\nLANE: I\u2019m Charles \u2026\nTRUMP: Yes, I know Charles.\nSTROMBERG: Steve Stromberg, editorial writer.\nTRUMP: Right.\nMARCUS: Ruth Marcus.\nTRUMP: Right.\nRYAN: Fred Ryan.\nTRUMP: Right, right.\nDIEHL: Jackson Diehl.\nTRUMP: Good.\nJAMES DOWNIE: James Downie, digital opinions editor.\nTRUMP: Hi, James.\nMICHAEL LARABEE: Mike Larabee, I\u2019m the op-ed editor.\nTRUMP: Yes.\nCHRISTINE EMBA: Christine Emba.\nTRUMP: Hi, Christine.\nJAMIE RILEY: Jamie Riley, letters and local opinions.\nTRUMP: Good, yes, yes.\nKAREN ATTIAH: Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor.\nHIATT: Karen, you want to get a question in?\nATTIAH: Uh, yeah, I mean speaking again of the system of what a lot of people would say are some of the uglier components of your campaign; a lot of people have said you\u2019ve been running a very divisive campaign as far as racial divides, you\u2019ve noted you know your comments about Muslims, about Mexicans, immigrants and such. You have information that the country is becoming browner, is becoming younger, is becoming blacker. What in your vision of president, in your presidency, how would you bridge these divides and how will you address a\u2013 how are you going to run on a message of inclusion of all Americans?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, if you look at some polls that have come out, I\u2019m doing very well with African Americans. I\u2019m doing, actually if you look at the polls, a lot of the polls that came out, in the, um, what do they call it? Exit polls, like from Nevada and other places, I\u2019m doing very well with Hispanics.\nATTIAH: I think some of the polls are saying you\u2019re doing [in the] negatives.\nTRUMP: We do, if it\u2019s illegals, in other words, if it\u2019s everybody, but people that are legally living here, I\u2019m doing very well. In other words, people that are here, like Hispanics that are in the country, I\u2019m doing very well. People that vote. Like people leaving voting booths and all, I\u2019m doing very well with them. I want to be inclusive, but at the same time, people should come here legally. They should be here legally. And I think the reason I\u2019m doing, that I will do well, especially once I get started, don\u2019t forget I haven\u2019t even focused on Hillary yet. And, and as you know, you know I\u2019ve had polls that are against me, but I\u2019ve had many polls that say I\u2019d beat Hillary, but they\u2019re not that, that, they don\u2019t mean anything now because it\u2019s too early. Because I haven\u2019t hit her. I\u2019ve only hit her once, and that was eight weeks ago, but, I haven\u2019t started on Hillary yet, and when I do I think I\u2019ll be able to make my points. I mean, you know, but, but I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you.\nATTIAH: But do you feel that your messages, your rhetoric, are dangerous and divisive for this country? How do you feel they\u2019re \u2026.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t think so. No, I don\u2019t think so. With the Muslim thing I think it\u2019s a serious problem. I\u2019ve had Muslims call and tell me you\u2019re right with the Muslim thing, I think it\u2019s a serious problem. And it\u2019s a problem that has to be addressed. I mean, there\u2019s tremendous hatred. Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, and he\u2019s living right next to where he grew up. There\u2019s a serious, serious problem with the Muslims and it\u2019s got to be addressed. It\u2019s temporary, and it\u2019s got to be addressed. And you know you may think of it as negative. Many people think it\u2019s very positive.\nHIATT: How would you identify people to keep them out of this country?\nTRUMP: Well look, there\u2019s many exceptions. There\u2019s many \u2013 everything, you\u2019re going to go through a process. But we have to be very careful. And I was really referring in particular, you know, to migrations \u2013 Syrians, the whole migration, where we\u2019re going to take in thousands. And I heard in the Democrat debate, I heard 55,000, okay. 55,000. Now they say it\u2019s really ten [thousand], but it\u2019s already 10, and I just don\u2019t think we can take people into this country. You saw what two people did \u2013 the woman and the man, whether she radicalized him or [inaudible] \u2013 but you saw what two people did, and I just don\u2019t think we can take people in when we have no idea who they are, where they come from. There\u2019s no documents, there\u2019s no paper, and we have ISIS looming over our head, and we have tremendous destruction. We lost the World Trade Center, we lost the Pentag \u2013 you know, we had a plane go into the Pentagon, etc.\nARMAO: D.C.: You told Chuck Todd last year on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that you love D.C., you love the people, that you want to do what\u2019s best for them. They think what\u2019s best for them is statehood or at the very least voting rights. What is your position on those two things?\nTRUMP: I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C. I think it\u2019s a tough thing. I don\u2019t have a position on it yet. I would form a position. But I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C.\nARMAO: Tough politically?\nTRUMP: I think it\u2019s just something that I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be inclined to do. I\u2019d like to study it. It\u2019s not a question really \u2013 maybe Chuck didn\u2019t ask me like you\u2019re asking me \u2013 I don\u2019t see statehood for D.C.\nARMAO: What about having a vote in the House of Representatives?\nTRUMP: I think that\u2019s something that would be okay. Having representation would be okay.\nHIATT: Last one: You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change?\nTRUMP: I think there\u2019s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. I\u2019m not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes \u2013 if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they don\u2019t know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now they\u2019re using \u201cextreme weather\u201d I guess more than any other phrase. I am not \u2013 I know it hurts me with this room, and I know it\u2019s probably a killer with this room \u2013 but I am not a believer. Perhaps there\u2019s a minor effect, but I\u2019m not a big believer in man-made climate change.\nSTROMBERG: Don\u2019t good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them?\nTRUMP: Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think we\u2019re in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me \u2013 I know President Obama thought it was climate change \u2013 to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. That\u2019s \u2013 that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we don\u2019t even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We don\u2019t know who has them. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons.\nRYAN: Thank you for joining us.",

Bernie Sanders speaks at a campaign rally at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, March 15, 2016. 0 Shares Email Bernie Sanders , the only Jewish presidential candidate this election cycle, was also the only candidate who elected not to attend the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) meeting this year. While all other candidates, including the remaining three Republicans and Hillary Clinton , spoke to the group in Washington, D.C ., today, Sanders instead took time while campaigning in Utah to deliver his own foreign policy speech, during which he had very pointed criticism for the Israeli government. During his remarks, which he described as the speech he would have given had he chosen to attend the powerful political lobby\u2019s event today, the senator called the U.S. and Israel long-term friends but said that because of that special relationship they were \u201cobligated to speak the truth\u201d to each other. Sanders Says He Would Ask Obama to Withdraw SCOTUS Nomination if Elected President \u201cThat is what real friendship demands, especially in difficult times. Our disagreements will come and go, and we must weather them constructively,\u201d he said. Sanders reminded the crowd of reporters and activists that he spent time living in Israel and working on a kibbutz, and argued that because of that he was \u201cprobably the only candidate\u201d with \u201cpersonal ties\u201d to the country. He specifically called it \u201cabsurd\u201d that a portion of Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019s government suggested increased settlements in the West Bank and added that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that they had withheld tax revenue from Palestinians. He talked about water and economic rights for Palestinians and said ending the economic blockade of Gaza would also be necessary for sustainable peace. \"I will work tirelessly to advance the cause of peace as a partner and as a friend to Israel. But to be successful, we have also have got to be a friend not only to Israel, but to the Palestinian people,\u201d he continued. The senator spoke at length about the need for Israel to end \u201cdisproportionate\u201d responses to being attacked. He talked specifically about the escalated violence in 2014. He strongly objected to Hamas' positions against Israel and condemned the group\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate rocket fire\u201d into Israeli territory, but then he pivoted to Israel\u2019s actions as well. \u201cLet me also be very clear: I -- along with many supporters of Israel \u2013 spoke out strongly against the Israeli counterattacks that killed nearly 1,500 civilians and wounded thousands more. I condemned the bombing of hospitals, schools and refugee camps. Today, Gaza is still largely in ruins. The international community must come together to help Gaza recover,\u201d he added. Sanders has consistently been a strong advocate for a two-state solution in the region, but so far has shied away from details on the topic on the campaign trail. His speech was especially noteworthy given the much more forceful defense of Israel lodged by Clinton, his primary opponent, today. 0 Shares",

      "text": "For AIPAC , it is crucial to appeal across the political spectrum. But Israel has become an increasingly divisive issue with the public. Credit Illustration by Matt Dorfman On July 23rd, officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2014the powerful lobbying group known as AIPAC\u2014gathered in a conference room at the Capitol for a closed meeting with a dozen Democratic senators. The agenda of the meeting, which was attended by other Jewish leaders as well, was the war in the Gaza Strip. In the century-long conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the previous two weeks had been particularly harrowing. In Israeli towns and cities, families heard sirens warning of incoming rockets and raced to shelters. In Gaza, there were scenes of utter devastation, with hundreds of Palestinian children dead from bombing and mortar fire. The Israeli government claimed that it had taken extraordinary measures to minimize civilian casualties, but the United Nations was launching an inquiry into possible war crimes. Even before the fighting escalated, the United States, Israel\u2019s closest ally, had made little secret of its frustration with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cHow will it have peace if it is unwilling to delineate a border, end the occupation, and allow for Palestinian sovereignty, security, and dignity?\u201d Philip Gordon, the White House co\u00f6rdinator for the Middle East, said in early July. \u201cIt cannot maintain military control of another people indefinitely. Doing so is not only wrong but a recipe for resentment and recurring instability.\u201d Although the Administration repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Israel, it was clearly uncomfortable with the scale of Israel\u2019s aggression. AIPAC did not share this unease; it endorsed a Senate resolution in support of Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend its citizens,\u201d which had seventy-nine co-sponsors and passed without a word of dissent. AIPAC is prideful about its influence. Its promotional literature points out that a reception during its annual policy conference, in Washington, \u201cwill be attended by more members of Congress than almost any other event, except for a joint session of Congress or a State of the Union address.\u201d A former AIPAC executive, Steven Rosen, was fond of telling people that he could take out a napkin at any Senate hangout and get signatures of support for one issue or another from scores of senators. AIPAC has more than a hundred thousand members, a network of seventeen regional offices, and a vast pool of donors. The lobby does not raise funds directly. Its members do, and the amount of money they channel to political candidates is difficult to track. But everybody in Congress recognizes its influence in elections, and the effect is evident. In 2011, when the Palestinians announced that they would petition the U.N. for statehood, AIPAC helped persuade four hundred and forty-six members of Congress to co-sponsor resolutions opposing the idea. During the Gaza conflict, AIPAC has made a priority of sending a message of bipartisan congressional support for all of Israel\u2019s actions. Pro-Israel resolutions passed by unanimous consent carry weight, but not nearly so much as military funding. During the fighting, Israel has relied on the Iron Dome system, a U.S.-funded missile defense that has largely neutralized Hamas\u2019s rockets. Although the U.S. was scheduled to deliver $351 million for the system starting in October, AIPAC wanted more money right away. On July 22nd, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had sent a letter to Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, seeking an immediate payment of $225 million. In the conference room, the senators sat on one side of a long table, the Jewish leaders on the other. Robert Cohen, the president of AIPAC, justified Israel\u2019s assault, agreeing with Netanyahu that Hamas was ultimately responsible for the deaths of its own citizens. At one point, Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, asked about conservative trends in Israel, a participant recalled. \u201cHe said that he supports Israel, but he\u2019s concerned that Israel is headed toward a one-state solution\u2014and that would be so damaging and dangerous for everyone involved.\u201d Charles Schumer, the senior Democrat from New York, interrupted. Turning to address the room, he said, \u201cIt troubles me when I hear people equate Israel and Hamas. That\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s terrible!\u201d Kaine protested, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Cohen simply repeated that Hamas was to blame for everything that was happening. The Senate, preparing for its August recess, hastened to vote on the Iron Dome funding. At first, the appropriation was bundled into an emergency bill that also included money to address the underage refugees flooding across the Mexican border. But, with only a few days left before the break began, that bill got mired in a partisan fight. Reid tried to package Iron Dome with money for fighting wildfires, and then offered it by itself; both efforts failed, stopped largely by budget hawks. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get it done the night before recess, you bemoan the fact that you couldn\u2019t get it done, and everybody goes home,\u201d a congressional staffer said. Instead, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, the Republican leader, decided to stay over, even if it meant missing an event at home. The next morning, with the halls of the Senate all but empty, an unusual session was convened so that McConnell and Reid could try again to pass the bill; Tim Kaine was also there, along with the Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham. \u201cThere were five senators present and literally no one else!\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThey reintroduced it and passed it. This was one of the more amazing feats, for AIPAC.\u201d In a press conference, Graham, who has been a major recipient of campaign contributions connected to AIPAC, pointed out that the funding for Iron Dome was intended as a gesture of solidarity with Israel. \u201cNot only are we going to give you more missiles\u2014we\u2019re going to be a better friend,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for you in the international court of public opinion. We\u2019re going to fight for you in the United Nations.\u201d The influence of AIPAC, like that of the lobbies for firearms, banking, defense, and energy interests, has long been a feature of politics in Washington, particularly on Capitol Hill. But that influence, like the community that AIPAC intends to represent, is not static. For decades, AIPAC has thrived on bipartisanship, exerting its influence on congressional Democrats and Republicans alike. But Israel\u2019s government, now dominated by a coalition of right-wing parties led by Likud, has made compromise far less likely than it was a generation ago. Prime Minister Netanyahu, the leader of Likud and an unabashed partisan of the Republican view of the world, took office at about the same time as President Obama, and the two have clashed frequently over the expansion of Israeli settlements and the contours of a potential peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Although both men repeatedly speak of the unshakable bond between the U.S. and Israel, their relationship has been fraught from the start. In 2012, Netanyahu made little secret of the fact that he hoped Mitt Romney would win the election. Time and again\u2014over issues ranging from Iran to the Palestinians\u2014AIPAC has sided strongly with Netanyahu against Obama. Buy a cartoon AIPAC\u2019s spokesman, Marshall Wittmann, said that the lobby had no loyalty to any political party, in Israel or in the U.S., and that to suggest otherwise was a \u201cmalicious mischaracterization.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cwe are a bipartisan organization of Americans who exercise our constitutional right to lobby the government.\u201d For AIPAC, whose stated mission is to improve relations between the U.S. and Israel, it is crucial to appeal across the political spectrum. In recent years, though, Israel has become an increasingly divisive issue among the American public. Support for Israel among Republicans is at seventy-three per cent, and at forty-four per cent among Democrats, according to a poll conducted in July by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press; the divide is even greater between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. This difference represents a schism among American Jews\u2014AIPAC\u2019s vital core. For decades, the Jewish community was generally united in its support for Israel. Today, a growing number of American Jews, though still devoted to Israel, struggle with the lack of progress toward peace with the Palestinians. Many feel that AIPAC does not speak for them. The Pew Center\u2019s survey found that only thirty-eight per cent of American Jews believe that the Israeli government is sincerely pursuing peace; forty-four per cent believe that the construction of new settlements damages Israel\u2019s national security. In a Gallup poll in late July, only a quarter of Americans under the age of thirty thought that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were justified. As Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the executive director of the left-leaning T\u2019ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, told me, \u201cMany people I know in their twenties and thirties say, I have a perfectly good Jewish life here\u2014why do I need to worry about this country in the Middle East where they\u2019re not representing who I am as a Jew? I\u2019m not proud of what\u2019s happening there. I\u2019m certainly not going to send money. \u201d This is precisely the kind of ambivalence that AIPAC adherents describe as destructive. And yet even Israeli politicians recognize that AIPAC faces a shifting landscape of opinion. Shimon Peres, who served as Prime Minister and, most recently, as President, says, \u201cMy impression is that AIPAC is weaker among the younger people. It has a solid majority of people of a certain age, but it\u2019s not the same among younger people.\u201d For AIPAC, the tension with the Obama Administration over Gaza comes amid a long series of conflicts. Perhaps the most significant of these is over the question of Iran\u2019s obtaining a nuclear weapon. Last October, Iran and the consortium of world powers known as P5+1\u2014Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United States\u2014met in Geneva to begin talks. For two decades, AIPAC has been warning that if Iran acquired nuclear arms it would pose an existential threat to Israel, which has had a nuclear capacity since the late sixties. Netanyahu has insisted that the United States\u2014or Israel alone, if necessary\u2014must be prepared to take military action against Iran. The Obama Administration, too, has said that a nuclear Iran is unthinkable and that \u201call options\u201d\u2014including military options\u2014\u201care on the table.\u201d But Netanyahu fears that Obama is prepared to settle for too little in the negotiations, and, when they began, he launched an uninhibited campaign of public diplomacy against them. In early November, after meeting in Jerusalem with Secretary of State John Kerry, he proclaimed a tentative proposal \u201ca very, very bad deal. It is the deal of the century for Iran.\u201d A photo op for the two men was abruptly cancelled, and Kerry returned to Switzerland. Later that month, Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., met with a bipartisan group of two dozen congressmen in the offices of John Boehner, the House Speaker. Dermer, who comes from a political family in Miami, worked in the nineties for the Republican consultant Frank Luntz as he shaped Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract with America campaign. A few years later, Dermer emigrated to Israel, where he worked as a political consultant and wrote columns for the Jerusalem Post, a conservative daily, in which he referred to Jews who denounced the occupation as \u201cself-haters.\u201d When Netanyahu took office in 2009, he brought in Dermer as a top adviser, and the two became virtually inseparable. \u201cWhenever we met with Bibi in the last several years, Dermer was there,\u201d a former congressional aide said. \u201cHe was like Bibi\u2019s Mini-Me.\u201d In Boehner\u2019s offices, a senior Democrat recalled, \u201cDermer was very critical of the proposed Iran nuclear agreement. He talked about how Reagan would never have done anything like this.\u201d Finally, one of the other politicians in the room had to advise him, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about what Reagan would do. He\u2019s not very popular with Democrats.\u201d The great incentive that the P5+1 could offer Iran was to reduce the sanctions that have crippled its economy. As the talks proceeded, though, Israel\u2019s supporters in Congress were talking about legislation that would instead toughen the sanctions. Dermer didn\u2019t say specifically that he favored such a law\u2014representatives of foreign governments customarily do not advocate for specific U.S. legislation\u2014but it was clear that that was what he and the Israeli leadership wanted. A former congressional staff member who attended the meeting said, \u201cThe implicit critique was the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the President.\u201d Obama\u2019s aides were alarmed by the possibility that AIPAC might endorse new sanctions legislation. They invited Howard Kohr, the group\u2019s chief executive officer, and officials from other prominent Jewish organizations to briefings at the White House. Members of the Administration\u2019s negotiating team, together with State Department officials, walked them through the issues. \u201cWe said, \u2018We know you guys are going to take a tough line on these negotiations, but stay inside the tent and work with us,\u2019 \u201d a senior Administration official recalled. \u201cWe told them directly that a sanctions bill would blow up the negotiations\u2014the Iranians would walk away from the table. They said, \u2018This bill is to strengthen your hand in diplomacy.\u2019 We kept saying, \u2018It doesn\u2019t strengthen our hand in diplomacy. Why do you know better than we do what strengthens our hand? Nobody involved in the diplomacy thinks that. \u2019 \u201d In late November, the negotiators announced an interim Joint Plan of Action. For a period of six months, Iran and the six world powers would work toward a comprehensive solution; in the meantime, Iran would limit its nuclear energy program in exchange for initial relief from sanctions. Netanyahu blasted the agreement, calling it a \u201chistoric mistake,\u201d and, within a few days, the leadership of AIPAC committed itself to fighting for new sanctions. A senior Democrat close to AIPAC described to me the intimate interplay between Netanyahu\u2019s circle and the lobby. \u201cThere are people in AIPAC who believe that it should be an arm of the Likud, an arm of the Republican Party,\u201d he said. Wittmann, the lobby\u2019s spokesman, disputed this, saying, \u201cAIPAC does not take any orders or direction from any foreign principal, in Israel or elsewhere.\u201d For the Israeli leadership and many of its advocates, the Iran negotiations presented an especially vexing problem of political triangulation. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran\u2019s previous President, had been a kind of ideal adversary, attracting widespread outrage by questioning whether the Holocaust had taken place and by challenging Israel\u2019s right to exist. Danny Ayalon, a former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., once described Ahmadinejad\u2019s hateful rhetoric to me as \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving.\u201d But Iran\u2019s new President, Hassan Rouhani, was carefully presenting himself as a relative moderate. Netanyahu would have none of it, calling Rouhani \u201ca wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d \u201cI come from a hundred years in the future to warn you that nothing really changes in the next hundred years.\u201d Buy a cartoon AIPAC worked to mobilize its friends in Congress. Mark Kirk, a Republican senator from Illinois and a major beneficiary of AIPAC-related funding, began pressing to pass a new sanctions bill. \u201cHe was saying, \u2018We\u2019re in negotiations with a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing!\u2019 \u201d a former Senate aide recalled. The bill, co-sponsored by Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, was drafted with considerable input from AIPAC. This was the first time in decades that the lobby had challenged the sitting U.S. President so overtly. The Obama Administration was furious. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to disagree on some aspect of the peace process, on things that are tough for Israel to do,\u201d the senior Administration official told me. \u201cBut this is American foreign policy that they were seeking to essentially derail. There was no other logic to it than ending the negotiations, and the gravity of that was shocking.\u201d AIPAC was incorporated in 1963, fifteen years after the State of Israel came into being. Its leader, Isaiah (Si) Kenen, had been a lobbyist for American Zionist organizations and an employee of Israel\u2019s Office of Information at the United Nations. In that job, Kenen had been obligated to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which had stringent disclosure requirements about financial expenditures and communications with the U.S. government. The journalist M. J. Rosenberg, who volunteered at AIPAC in 1973 and is now a critic of it, recalled Kenen\u2019s saying that the foreign-agent model was too restrictive. AIPAC would lobby Congress for aid to Israel, but its members would be Americans, taking orders from an American board of directors. Rosenberg told me that Kenen was \u201can old-fashioned liberal\u201d who liked to say, \u201cAIPAC has no enemies, only friends and potential friends.\u201d When asked which politicians he hoped to elect, he said, \u201cWe play with the hand that is dealt us.\u201d Congress must lead, he said, and \u201cour job is to help it lead.\u201d Kenen retired in 1974, and by the late eighties AIPAC\u2019s board had come to be dominated by a group of wealthy Jewish businessmen known as the Gang of Four: Mayer (Bubba) Mitchell, Edward Levy, Jr., Robert Asher, and Larry Weinberg. Weinberg was a Democrat who gradually moved to the right. The others were Republicans. In 1980, AIPAC hired Thomas Dine, a former diplomat and congressional staffer, as its executive director. Dine set out to develop a nationwide network that would enable AIPAC to influence every member of Congress. This was a daunting challenge. Jews made up less than three per cent of the American population, concentrated in nine states, and they voted overwhelmingly Democratic. How could AIPAC, with such a small base, become a political force in both parties and in every state? Dine launched a grass-roots campaign, sending young staff members around the country to search for Jews in states where there were few. In Lubbock, Texas, for instance, they found nine who were willing to meet\u2014a tiny group who cared deeply about Israel but never thought that they could play a political role. The lobby created four hundred and thirty-five \u201ccongressional caucuses,\u201d groups of activists who would meet with their member of Congress to talk about the pro-Israel agenda. Dine decided that \u201cif you wanted to have influence you had to be a fund-raiser.\u201d Despite its name, AIPAC is not a political-action committee, and therefore cannot contribute to campaigns. But in the eighties, as campaign-finance laws changed and PACs proliferated, AIPAC helped form pro-Israel PACs. By the end of the decade, there were dozens. Most had generic-sounding names, like Heartland Political Action Committee, and they formed a loose constellation around AIPAC. Though there was no formal relationship, in many cases the leader was an AIPAC member, and as the PACs raised funds they looked to the broader organization for direction. Members\u2019 contributions were often bundled. \u201cAIPAC will select some dentist in Boise, say, to be the bundler,\u201d a former longtime AIPAC member said. \u201cThey tell people in New York and other cities to send their five-thousand-dollar checks to him. But AIPAC has to teach people discipline\u2014because all those people who are giving five thousand dollars would ordinarily want recognition. The purpose is to make the dentist into a big shot\u2014he\u2019s the one who has all this money to give to the congressman\u2019s campaign.\u201d AIPAC representatives tried to match each member of Congress with a contact who shared the congressman\u2019s interests. If a member of Congress rode a Harley-Davidson, AIPAC found a contact who did, too. The goal was to develop people who could get a member of Congress on the phone at a moment\u2019s notice. That persistence and persuasion paid off. Howard Berman, a former congressman from California, recalled that Bubba Mitchell became friends with Sonny Callahan, a fellow-resident of Mobile, Alabama, when Callahan ran for Congress in 1984. Eventually, Callahan became chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. \u201cSonny had always been against foreign aid,\u201d Berman said. \u201cThen he voted for it!\u201d Republicans knew that they would never get more than a minority of the Jewish electorate, but AIPAC members convinced them that voting the right way would lead to campaign contributions. It was a winning argument. In 1984, Mitch McConnell narrowly beat AIPAC supporters\u2019 preferred candidate, the incumbent Democrat Walter Huddleston. Afterward, McConnell met with two AIPAC officials and said to them, \u201cLet me be very clear. What do I need to do to make sure that the next time around I get the community support?\u201d AIPAC members let Republicans know that, if they supported AIPAC positions, the lobby would view them as \u201cfriendly incumbents,\u201d and would not abandon them for a Democratic challenger. The Connecticut Republican senator Lowell Weicker voted consistently with AIPAC; in 1988, he was challenged by the Democrat Joe Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew. Lieberman won, but Weicker got the majority of funding from Jewish donors. In the early days, Howard Berman said, \u201cAIPAC was knocking on an unlocked door.\u201d Most Americans have been favorably disposed toward Israel since its founding, and no other lobby spoke for them on a national scale. Unlike other lobbies\u2014such as the N.R.A., which is opposed by various anti-gun groups\u2014AIPAC did not face a significant and well-funded countervailing force. It also had the resources to finance an expensive and emotionally charged form of persuasion. Dine estimated that in the eighties and nineties contributions from AIPAC members often constituted roughly ten to fifteen per cent of a typical congressional campaign budget. AIPAC provided lavish trips to Israel for legislators and other opinion-makers. Nevertheless, the lobby did not endorse or rank candidates. \u201cWe made the decision to be one step removed,\u201d Dine said. \u201cOrrin Hatch once said, \u2018Dine, your genius is to play an invisible bass drum, and the Jews hear it when you play it.\u2019 \u201d In 1982, after an Illinois congressman named Paul Findley described himself as \u201cYasir Arafat\u2019s best friend in Congress,\u201d AIPAC members encouraged Dick Durbin, a political unknown, to run against him. Robert Asher, a Chicago businessman, sent out scores of letters to his friends, along with Durbin\u2019s position paper on Israel, asking them to send checks. Durbin won, and he is now the Senate Majority Whip. (Findley later wrote a book that made extravagant claims about the power of the Israel lobby.) In 1984, AIPAC affiliates decided that Senator Charles Percy, an Illinois Republican, was unfriendly to Israel. In the next election, Paul Simon, a liberal Democrat, won Percy\u2019s seat. Dine said at the time, \u201cJews in America, from coast to coast, gathered to oust Percy. And American politicians\u2014those who hold public positions now, and those who aspire\u2014got the message.\u201d \u201cFor a militia, he\u2019s not very well regulated.\u201d Buy a cartoon As AIPAC grew, its leaders began to conceive of their mission as something more than winning support and aid for Israel. The Gang of Four, a former AIPAC official noted, \u201ccreated an interesting mantra that they honestly believed: that, if AIPAC had existed prior to the Second World War, America would have stopped Hitler. It\u2019s a great motivator, and a great fund-raiser\u2014but I think it\u2019s also AIPAC\u2019s greatest weakness. Because if you convince yourself that, if only you had been around, six million Jews would not have been killed, then you sort of lose sight of the fact that the U.S. has its own foreign policy, and, while it is extremely friendly to Israel, it will only go so far.\u201d In the fall of 1991, President George H. W. Bush decided to delay ten billion dollars in loan guarantees to Israel, largely because of the continuing expansion of settlements. In response, AIPAC sent activists to Capitol Hill. The lobby was confident. Its officials had told Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli Prime Minister at the time, that Bush did not have the political desire to take on AIPAC, according to a memoir by former Secretary of State James Baker. But Bush proved willing to fight. The former AIPAC official recalled that Bubba Mitchell was summoned to the White House for a meeting: \u201cWhen he came back to the AIPAC boardroom, an hour after the meeting, he was still shaking\u2014because the President of the United States yelled at him!\u201d Soon afterward, Bush remarked that he was \u201cone lonely little guy\u201d fighting \u201csomething like a thousand lobbyists.\u201d The Senate lined up behind him, and voted to postpone consideration of the loan guarantees. For AIPAC, this marked the beginning of a difficult period. The next June, Israeli voters ousted Shamir and his Likud Party and voted in Labor, headed by Yitzhak Rabin. After a career of military campaigns and cautious politics, Rabin began a transformation, offering to scale back settlement activity. In response, Bush asked Congress to approve the loan guarantees. Afterward, Rabin admonished the leaders of AIPAC, telling them that they had done more harm than good by waging battles \u201cthat were lost in advance.\u201d Daniel Kurtzer, then the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told me, \u201cRabin was furious with AIPAC. He felt they were allied with Likud and would undermine him in what he was trying to do.\u201d In September, 1993, Rabin and Arafat signed the Oslo Accords, which were aimed at building a formal peace process with the Palestine Liberation Organization. AIPAC officially endorsed the agreement, and still does. But many members were uncomfortable with it, according to Keith Weissman, a former analyst for the lobby. \u201cAIPAC couldn\u2019t act like they were rejecting what the government of Israel did, but the outcry in the organization about Oslo was so great that they found ways to sabotage it,\u201d he said. (In 2005, Weissman was indicted, along with Steven Rosen, for conspiring to pass national-defense information to a reporter and an Israeli government agent, and AIPAC fired them. The charges were ultimately dropped.) As part of the agreement, the U.S. was to make funds available to the Palestinians, Weissman said. \u201cThe Israelis wanted the money to go to Arafat, for what they called \u2018walking-around money.\u2019 But AIPAC supported a bill in Congress to make sure that the money was never given directly to Arafat and his people, and to monitor closely what was done with it. And, because I knew Arabic, they had me following all of Arafat\u2019s speeches. Was he saying one thing here, and another thing there? Our department became P.L.O. compliance-watchers. The idea was to cripple Oslo.\u201d In 1995, AIPAC encouraged Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House, to support bipartisan legislation to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This put Rabin in a political corner. On one hand, he knew that such a move would infuriate the Arab world and endanger the Oslo process. On the other, as Yossi Beilin, then an official in the Labor government, pointed out, \u201cYou are the Prime Minister of Israel and you are telling American Jews, \u2018Don\u2019t ask for recognition of Jerusalem as our capital\u2019? Nobody can do that!\u201d At a dinner with AIPAC leaders, Rabin told them that he did not support the bill; they continued to promote it nonetheless. In October, the bill passed in Congress, by an overwhelming majority. President Bill Clinton invoked a national-security waiver to prevent its enactment, and so has every President since. In 1999, Ehud Barak, also of the Labor Party, became Prime Minister, and, as Rabin had, he grew friendly with Clinton. \u201cAIPAC flourishes when there is tension between Israel and the U.S., because then they have a role to play,\u201d Gadi Baltiansky, who was Barak\u2019s press spokesman, told me. \u201cBut the relations between Rabin and Clinton, and then Barak and Clinton, were so good that AIPAC was not needed. Barak gave them courtesy meetings. He just didn\u2019t see them as real players.\u201d Still, the lobby maintained its sway in Congress. In 2000, Barak sent Beilin, who was then the Justice Minister, to obtain money that Clinton had promised Israel but never released. Beilin went to see Sandy Berger, Clinton\u2019s national-security adviser. \u201cHe said this money is tied to two hundred and twenty-five million dollars in assistance to Egypt,\u201d Beilin recalled. \u201cWe cannot disburse the money to Israel unless we do to Egypt, so we need to convince Congress to support the whole package. I said, \u2018I am speaking on behalf of my Prime Minister. We want Egypt to get the money.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yossi, this is really wonderful. Do you know somebody in AIPAC?\u2019 \u201d Beilin was astonished: \u201cIt was kind of Kafka\u2014the U.S. national-security adviser is asking the Minister of Justice in Israel whether he knows somebody at AIPAC!\u201d He went to see Howard Kohr, the AIPAC C.E.O., a onetime employee of the Republican Jewish Coalition whom a former U.S. government official described to me as \u201ca comfortable Likudnik.\u201d Kohr told Beilin that it was impossible to allow Egypt to get the money. \u201cYou may think it was wrong for Israel to vote for Barak as Prime Minister\u2014fine,\u201d Beilin recalled saying. \u201cBut do you really believe that you represent Israel more than all of us?\u201d By the end of Barak\u2019s term, in 2001, the money had not been released, to Israel or to Egypt. \u201cThey always want to punish the Arabs,\u201d Beilin concluded. \u201cThey are a very rightist organization, which doesn\u2019t represent the majority of Jews in America, who are so Democratic and liberal. They want to protect Israel from itself\u2014especially when moderate people are Israel\u2019s leaders.\u201d In the spring of 2008, AIPAC moved from cramped quarters on Capitol Hill to a gleaming new seven-story building on H Street, downtown. At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Howard Kohr introduced Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate who had been a generous donor to AIPAC since the nineties, and who had helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel (paying only for Republican members). On this bright spring day, according to someone who was in the audience, Adelson recalled that Kohr had telephoned him, asking him to have lunch. Adelson remembered wondering, How much is this lunch going to cost me? Well, he went on, it cost him ten million dollars: the building was the result. He later told his wife that Kohr should have asked him for fifty million. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to join the Sea Level Club, either.\u201d Buy a cartoon Netanyahu became Prime Minister the following year. AIPAC officials had been close to him since the eighties, when he worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, and stuck with him when, in 1990, he was banned from the State Department for saying that U.S. policy was built \u201con a foundation of distortion and lies.\u201d As Prime Minister, Netanyahu had a difficult relationship with Bill Clinton, largely because Clinton found him unwilling to stop the expansion of settlements and to meaningfully advance the peace process\u2014a sharp contrast with the approach of Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995. Then as now, Netanyahu displayed a vivid sense of his own historical importance, as well as flashes of disdain for the American President. After their first meeting, Clinton sent a message to another Israeli, wryly complaining that he had emerged uncertain who, exactly, was the President of a superpower. But, even if Netanyahu had trouble with the executive branch, AIPAC could help deliver the support of Congress, and a friendly Congress could take away the President\u2019s strongest negotiating chit\u2014the multibillion-dollar packages of military aid that go to Israel each year. The same dynamic was repeated during Barack Obama\u2019s first term. Israeli conservatives were wary, sensing that Obama, in their terms, was a leftist, sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. They took note when, during the 2008 campaign, Obama said, \u201cI think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you\u2019re opposed to Israel, that you\u2019re anti-Israel, and that can\u2019t be the measure of our friendship with Israel.\u201d At Obama\u2019s first meeting with Netanyahu, in May, 2009, Dermer came along, and found himself unable to observe the well-established protocol that one does not interrupt the President. As Obama spoke, Dermer\u2019s hand shot up: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. President, I beg to differ!\u201d Obama demanded a full settlement freeze, as a means of convincing the Palestinians that Netanyahu was not merely stalling the Americans. Netanyahu was incensed, and AIPAC rallied members of Congress to protest. At an AIPAC conference, Dermer declared that Netanyahu would chart his own course with the Palestinians: \u201cThe days of continuing down the same path of weakness and capitulation and concessions, hoping\u2014hoping\u2014that somehow the Palestinians would respond in kind, are over.\u201d Applause swept the room. In a speech at Bar-Ilan University, in June, 2009, Netanyahu seemed to endorse a two-state solution, if in rather guarded terms. Leaders of the settler movement and even many of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud allies were furious at this seemingly historic shift for the Party, though, with time, many of them interpreted the speech as a tactical sop to the United States. No less significant, perhaps, Netanyahu introduced a condition that could make a final resolution impossible\u2014the demand that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state. \u201cIt was a stroke of political brilliance,\u201d the former Senate aide, who had worked closely with Dermer, told me. \u201cHe managed to take the two-state issue off the table and put it back on the Palestinians.\u201d In March, 2010, while Vice-President Joe Biden was visiting Israel, the Netanyahu government announced that it was building sixteen hundred new housing units for Jews in Ramat Shlomo, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Biden said that the move \u201cundermines the trust we need right now.\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Netanyahu to upbraid him. But, while Obama and his team viewed the move as a political insult and yet another blow to a potential two-state solution, AIPAC went into defensive mode, sending an e-mail to its members saying that the Administration\u2019s criticisms of Israel were \u201ca matter of serious concern.\u201d Soon afterward, a letter circulated in the House calling on the Obama Administration to \u201creinforce\u201d the relationship. Three hundred and twenty-seven House members signed it. A couple of months later, when the U.S. tried to extend a partial moratorium on construction in settlements in the West Bank, AIPAC fought against the extension. Obama eventually yielded. In May, 2011, Obama gave a speech about the Arab Spring, and, hoping to break the stalemate in the peace talks, he said, \u201cThe borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps.\u201d The 1967 borders, with some adjustments, had long been recognized as the foundation for a peace agreement, but Obama was the first President to utter the words so explicitly. The next day, Netanyahu arrived in Washington and rebuked him in the Oval Office, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to those indefensible lines.\u201d A veteran Israeli politician was aghast at Netanyahu\u2019s performance. \u201cThis is the President of the United States of America, and you are the head of a client state\u2014let\u2019s not forget that!\u201d he said. \u201cAIPAC should have come to Bibi and said, \u2018You don\u2019t talk to the President the way you do! This is not done, you have to stop it!\u2019 Instead of reflecting almost automatically everything the Israeli government is doing and pushing in that direction.\u201d AIPAC officially supports a two-state solution, but many of its members, and many of the speakers at its conferences, loudly oppose such an agreement. Tom Dine has said that the lobby\u2019s tacit position is \u201cWe\u2019ll work against it until it happens.\u201d After Obama endorsed the 1967 borders, AIPAC members called Congress to express outrage. \u201cThey wanted the President to feel the heat from Israel\u2019s friends on the Hill,\u201d a former Israeli official recalled. \u201cThey were saying to the Administration, \u2018You must rephrase, you must correct!\u2019 \u201d When Obama appeared at an AIPAC policy conference three days later, he was conciliatory: \u201cThe parties themselves\u2014Israelis and Palestinians\u2014will negotiate a border that is different than the one that existed on June 4, 1967. That\u2019s what \u2018mutually agreed-upon swaps\u2019 means.\u201d AIPAC had e-mailed videos to attendees, urging them not to boo the President; they complied, offering occasional wan applause. The next day, Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress and received twenty-nine standing ovations. Fifty years ago, before Israel became an undeclared nuclear power and its existence was under threat, any differences it had with the U.S. were usually aired in private. Today, the political dynamics in both countries\u2014and the particulars of the relationship\u2014have evolved. A majority of Israelis still favor the idea of a two-state solution, but the political mood has shifted markedly to the right. The reasons range from the deeply felt notion that the Palestinians were \u201coffered the world and rejected it\u201d to the rise of Hamas in Gaza, from the aftershock of terror attacks a decade ago to the instability throughout the Middle East. Likud has rejected relative moderates like Dan Meridor and Benny Begin; Netanyahu himself is considered a \u201cdove\u201d by some leaders of his coalition and members of his party. The consensus deepens that Oslo was a failure, and that, as Netanyahu says, \u201cthere is no partner for peace.\u201d The Palestinians, for their part, argue that the settlements in the West Bank and Jewish expansion into East Jerusalem have created a \u201cone-state reality.\u201d They point out that members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition reject a two-state solution\u2014\u201cThe land is ours!\u201d\u2014and endorse permanent Israeli control, or outright annexation, of the West Bank. Netanyahu prides himself on understanding the American political climate. But his deepest relationships are with older, often wealthy members of the establishments in New York and Los Angeles, and he is less conscious of the changes in American demographics and in opinion among younger American Jews. Assaf Sharon, the research director of Molad, a progressive think tank in Jerusalem, said, \u201cWhen Israelis see House members jump like springs to applaud every lame comment Bibi utters, they think he is a star in Washington. Then they are told by the local pundits that everything else is just personal friction with Obama. My sense is that the people surrounding Bibi\u2014and the Prime Minister himself\u2014don\u2019t appreciate the significance of the shift.\u201d Buy a cartoon Yet the rhetoric of Netanyahu\u2019s circle has never been more confident. In a recent talk, Dermer argued that Israel is a regional superpower, with much to give in its relationship with the U.S. \u201cAmerica\u2019s most important ally in the twentieth century was Great Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cYour most important ally in the twenty-first century is going to be the State of Israel.\u201d In a meeting with young Likud supporters last spring, which one of them transcribed online, Netanyahu boasted of defying Obama\u2019s pressure to halt settlements; 2013 was a record year for settlement construction in the West Bank. He preferred to \u201cstand up to international pressure by maneuvering,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is that we continue to head straight toward our goal, even if one time we walk right and another time walk left.\u201d When one of the Likudniks asked about peace talks with the Palestinians, Netanyahu is said to have replied, as the audience laughed, \u201cAbout the\u2014what?\u201d AIPAC\u2019s hold on Congress has become institutionalized. Each year, a month or two before the annual policy conference, AIPAC officials tell key members what measures they want, so that their activists have something to lobby for. \u201cEvery year, we create major legislation, so they can justify their existence to their members,\u201d the former congressional aide said. (AIPAC maintains that only members of Congress initiate legislative action.) AIPAC board meetings are held in Washington each month, and directors visit members of Congress. They generally address them by their first names, even if they haven\u2019t met before. The intimacy is presumed, but also, at times, earned; local AIPAC staffers, in the manner of basketball recruiters, befriend some members when they are still serving on the student council. \u201cIf you have a dream about running for office, AIPAC calls you,\u201d one House member said. Certainly, it\u2019s a rarity when someone undertakes a campaign for the House or the Senate today without hearing from AIPAC. In 1996, Brian Baird, a psychologist from Seattle, decided to run for Congress. Local Democrats asked if he had thought about what he was going to say to AIPAC. \u201cI had admired Israel since I was a kid,\u201d Baird told me. \u201cBut I also was fairly sympathetic to peaceful resolution and the Palestinian side. These people said, \u2018We respect that, but let\u2019s talk about the issues and what you might say.\u2019 The difficult reality is this: in order to get elected to Congress, if you\u2019re not independently wealthy, you have to raise a lot of money. And you learn pretty quickly that, if AIPAC is on your side, you can do that. They come to you and say, \u2018We\u2019d be happy to host ten-thousand-dollar fund-raisers for you, and let us help write your annual letter, and please come to this multi-thousand-person dinner.\u2019 \u201d Baird continued, \u201cAny member of Congress knows that AIPAC is associated indirectly with significant amounts of campaign spending if you\u2019re with them, and significant amounts against you if you\u2019re not with them.\u201d For Baird, AIPAC-connected money amounted to about two hundred thousand dollars in each of his races\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s two hundred thousand going your way, versus the other way: a four-hundred-thousand-dollar swing.\u201d The contributions, as with many interest groups, come with a great deal of tactical input. \u201cThe AIPAC people do a very good job of \u2018informing\u2019 you about the issues,\u201d Baird told me. \u201cIt literally gets down to \u2018No, we don\u2019t say it that way, we say it this way.\u2019 Always phrased as a friendly suggestion\u2014but it\u2019s pretty clear you don\u2019t want to say \u2018occupied territories\u2019! There\u2019s a whole complex semantic code you learn. . . . After a while, you find yourself saying and repeating it as if it were fact.\u201d Soon after taking office, Baird went on a \u201cvirtually obligatory\u201d trip to Israel: a freshman ritual in which everything\u2014business-class flights, accommodations at the King David or the Citadel\u2014is paid for by AIPAC\u2019s charitable arm. The tours are carefully curated. \u201cThey do have you meet with the Palestinian leaders, in a sort of token process,\u201d Baird said. \u201cBut then when you\u2019re done with it they tell you everything the Palestinian leaders said that\u2019s wrong. And, of course, the Palestinians don\u2019t get to have dinner with you at the hotel that night.\u201d In early 2009, after a brief truce between Israel and Hamas collapsed in a series of mutual provocations, Israel carried out Operation Cast Lead, an incursion into Gaza in which nearly fourteen hundred Palestinians were killed, along with thirteen Israelis. Baird visited the area a few weeks later and returned several times. As he wrote in an op-ed, he saw \u201cfirsthand the devastating destruction of hospitals, schools, homes, industries, and infrastructure.\u201d That September, the U.N. Human Rights Council issued a report, based on an inquiry led by the South African jurist Richard Goldstone, that accused Israel of a series of possible war crimes. AIPAC attacked the report, saying it was \u201crigged.\u201d A month later, an AIPAC-sponsored resolution to condemn the report was introduced in the House, and three hundred and forty-four members voted in favor. \u201cI read every single word of that report, and it comported with what I had seen and heard on the ground in Gaza,\u201d Baird said. \u201cWhen we had the vote, I said, \u2018We have member after member coming to the floor to vote on a resolution they\u2019ve never read, about a report they\u2019ve never seen, in a place they\u2019ve never been.\u2019 \u201d Goldstone came under such pressure that threats were made to ban him from his grandson\u2019s bar mitzvah at a Johannesburg synagogue. He eventually wrote an op-ed in which he expressed regret for his conclusions, saying, \u201cCivilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy.\u201d Other members of the council stood by the report. In 2010, Baird decided not to run again for the House; he is now the president of Antioch University Seattle. Few current members of Congress are as outspoken about AIPAC as Baird. Staff members fret about whether AIPAC will prevent them from getting a good consulting job when they leave government. \u201cYou just hear the name!\u201d a Senate aide said. \u201cYou hear that they are involved and everyone\u2019s ears perk up and their mood changes, and they start to fall in line in a certain way.\u201d Baird said, \u201cWhen key votes are cast, the question on the House floor, troublingly, is often not \u2018What is the right thing to do for the United States of America?\u2019 but \u2018How is AIPAC going to score this?\u2019 \u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s such a conundrum here, of believing that you\u2019re supporting Israel, when you\u2019re actually backing policies that are antithetical to its highest values and, ultimately, destructive for the country.\u201d In talks with Israeli officials, he found that his inquiries were not treated with much respect. In 2003, one of his constituents, Rachel Corrie, was killed by a bulldozer driven by an Israeli soldier, as she protested the demolition of Palestinians\u2019 homes in Gaza. At first, he said, the officials told him, \u201cThere\u2019s a simple explanation\u2014here are the facts.\u201d Or, \u201cWe will look into it.\u201d But, when he continued to press, something else would emerge. \u201cThere is a disdain for the U.S., and a dismissal of any legitimacy of our right to question\u2014because who are we to talk about moral values?\u201d Baird told me. \u201cWhether it\u2019s that we didn\u2019t help early enough in the Holocaust, or look at what we did to our African-Americans, or our Native Americans\u2014whatever! And they see us, members of Congress, as basically for sale. So they want us to shut up and play the game.\u201d \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t see the big deal about the ice-bucket challenge.\u201d Buy a cartoon In 2007, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, two leading political scientists of the realist school, published a book called \u201cThe Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy.\u201d The book, a best-seller, presented a scathing portrait of AIPAC, arguing that the lobby had a nearly singular distorting influence on American foreign policy, and even that it was a central factor in the rush to war in Iraq. While the authors\u2019 supporters praised their daring, their critics argued that they had neglected to point out any failures of the Palestinian leadership, and painted AIPAC in conspiratorial, omnipotent tones. Even Noam Chomsky, a fierce critic of Israel from the left, wrote that the authors had exaggerated the influence of AIPAC, and that other special interests, like the energy lobby, had greater influence on Middle East policy. A broader political challenge to AIPAC came in 2009, with the founding of J Street, a \u201cpro-Israel, pro-peace\u201d advocacy group. Led by Jeremy Ben-Ami, a former Clinton Administration aide whose grandparents were among the first settlers in Tel Aviv, J Street was founded to appeal to American Jews who strongly support a two-state solution and who see the occupation as a threat to democracy and to Jewish values. J Street has only a tiny fraction of AIPAC\u2019s financial power and influence on Capitol Hill, but it has tried to provide at least some campaign funding to weaken the lobby\u2019s grip. AIPAC and its allies have responded aggressively. This year, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations voted not to admit J Street, because, as the leader of one Orthodox alliance said to the Times, its \u201cpositions are out of the mainstream of what could be considered acceptable within the Jewish community.\u201d Danny Ayalon, the former Israeli Ambassador, told me, \u201cWhen Jewish organizations join the political campaign to delegitimatize Israel, they are really undermining our security collectively. Because I do believe that, if Israel\u2019s security is compromised, so is that of every Jew in the world.\u201d Many Israeli and Palestinian leaders have taken note of the rise of J Street and, without overestimating its capacities, see that it represents an increasing diversity of opinion in the American Jewish community. At the last J Street convention, in Washington, Husam Zomlot, a rising figure in Fatah, the largest faction in the P.L.O., delivered a speech about the Palestinian cause and got a standing ovation. \u201cAIPAC is not as effective as it was,\u201d Zomlot said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say J Street is the mainstream representative of Jewish Americans, but it is a trend that gives you some sense of where things are and what is happening. Though it has limited funding, it is the first organized Jewish group with a different agenda in Washington since Israel was established. It\u2019s worth noticing.\u201d Some politicians in Washington have indeed noticed, and not always to their benefit. Soon after J Street got started, it endorsed Robert Wexler, a Democratic congressman who represented a South Florida district. \u201cSome AIPAC people told me they would not support me anymore if I went to a J Street event or took their support,\u201d Wexler recalled. \u201cI called them and said, \u2018You\u2019ve supported me for twelve years. You\u2019re not going to support me because somebody from J Street endorsed me?\u2019 \u201d Wexler added, \u201cAIPAC is still by a factor of a hundred to one the premier lobbying organization for the Jewish community. I\u2019ll never understand why they care one iota about J Street\u2014but they have this bizarre fixation on it.\u201d Jan Schakowsky, who has represented a liberal Chicago district since 1999, was another of J Street\u2019s first endorsees. For years, she had maintained good relations with AIPAC, whose members * gave money to her campaigns and praised her positions. She voted to condemn the Goldstone report and signed a 2010 letter urging the Administration to keep any differences with Israel private. But in her 2010 race, she was challenged by Joel Pollak, an Orthodox Jew, who argued that she was insufficiently supportive of Israel. \u201cWe were very much aware that AIPAC-associated people were fund-raising for Jan\u2019s opponent,\u201d Dylan Williams, the director of government affairs for J Street, said. A small but vocal contingent of AIPAC members were behind Pollak. But he was also backed by the Tea Party, which J Street believed might drive away other Jewish voters. The new lobby raised seventy-five thousand dollars for Schakowsky (through its PAC, whose financial contributions are publicly disclosed), and she won by a wide margin. \u201cIt was exactly the type of race we had hoped for!\u201d Williams said. \u201cA lot of the power of AIPAC is based on this perception, which I believe is a myth, that if you cross their line you will be targeted, and your opponent in your next race will receive all this money, and it will make a difference.\u201d Still, Schakowsky told me, the process was painful. \u201cGetting booed in a synagogue was not a pleasure,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not just my base\u2014it\u2019s my family!\u201d She added, \u201cIncreasingly, Israel has become a wedge issue, something to be used against the President by the Republicans, and it can be very unhelpful.\u201d AIPAC is still capable of mounting a show of bipartisanship. At this year\u2019s policy conference, Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic Whip, appeared onstage with Eric Cantor, then the Republican House Majority Leader, and together they rhapsodized about the summer trip they routinely took, leading groups of mostly freshmen on an AIPAC tour of Israel. \u201cFew things are as meaningful as watching your colleagues discover the Jewish state for the very first time,\u201d Cantor said. Hoyer offered a benediction: \u201cWe Baptists would say, \u2018Amen.\u2019 \u201d Cantor and Hoyer have been steadfast supporters of AIPAC, and its members have held at least a dozen fund-raisers for them each year. But last December AIPAC\u2019s efforts to implement sanctions against Iran were so intense that even this well-tempered partnership fractured. When Congress returned from its Thanksgiving recess, legislators in the House began discussing a sanctions bill. According to the former congressional aide, Cantor told Hoyer that he wanted a bill that would kill the interim agreement with Iran. Hoyer refused, saying that he would collaborate only on a nonbinding resolution. Cantor sent Hoyer a resolution that called for additional sanctions and sought to define in advance the contours of an agreement with Iran. \u201cThe pressure was tremendous\u2014not just AIPAC leadership and legislative officials but various board members and other contributors, from all over the country,\u201d the former congressional aide recalled. \u201cWhat was striking was how strident the message was,\u201d another aide said. \u201c \u2018How could you not pass a resolution that tells the President what the outcome of the negotiations has to be?\u2019 \u201d Advocates for the sanctions portrayed Obama as feckless. \u201cThey said, \u2018Iranians have been doing this for millennia. They can smell weakness. Why is the President showing weakness?\u2019 \u201d a Senate aide recalled. AIPAC was betting that the Democrats, facing midterms with an unpopular President, would break ranks, and that Obama would be unable to stop them. Its confidence was not unfounded; every time Netanyahu and AIPAC had opposed Obama, he had retreated. But Obama took up the fight with unusual vigor. He has been deeply interested in nonproliferation since his college days, and he has been searching for an opening with Iran since his Presidential campaign in 2008. As the Cantor-Hoyer resolution gathered momentum, House Democrats began holding meetings at the White House to strategize about how to oppose it. \u201cWait\u2014I almost forgot why I called.\u201d April 18, 2005 Buy a cartoon Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the head of the Democratic National Committee, attended the meetings, at some political risk. Wasserman Schultz represents a heavily Jewish district in South Florida, and has been a reliable signature on AIPAC\u2019s letters and resolutions; she has boasted of concurring with a hundred per cent of its positions. Now the lobby e-mailed out an \u201cAIPAC Action Alert,\u201d including the text of a story about the meetings in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, in which she was described as \u201csiding with the Mullahs over the American people.\u201d The alert asked AIPAC\u2019s executive-council members to contact her office, ask if the story was true, and challenge her opposition to Cantor-Hoyer. Stephen Fiske, the chair of the pro-Israel Florida Congressional Committee PAC, sent a similar alert to Wasserman Schultz\u2019s constituents, setting off a cascade of calls to her office. (Fiske told the Free Beacon that the callers included a team of young students: his son\u2019s classmates at a Jewish day school in North Miami Beach.) Wasserman Schultz was furious. Soon afterward, she flew to Israel for the funeral of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. On the trip, she remarked to a colleague, \u201cThey\u2019re doing this to me?\u201d But as the meetings continued Democrats began to build a consensus. In December, Ester Kurz, AIPAC\u2019s director of legislative strategy, went to see Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader, to urge her to pass the resolution. Pelosi resisted, pointing out that many members of Hoyer\u2019s caucus strongly opposed it. David Price, a Democrat, and Charles Dent, a Republican, had written a letter to the President, urging him to use the diplomatic opening that followed Rouhani\u2019s election to attempt a nuclear agreement; it garnered a hundred and thirty-one signatures. Pointing to the letter, Pelosi demanded to know why AIPAC wanted this resolution, at this time. The members of Hoyer\u2019s caucus pressed him, and, on December 12th, just as the language of the resolution became final, he asked to set aside the effort, saying that the time was not right. His demurral\u2014from someone who had rarely disappointed AIPAC\u2014was a sign that the lobby might be in uncharted terrain. Two weeks after local AIPAC activists pressured Wasserman Schultz, a national board member issued a statement that called her \u201ca good friend of Israel and a close friend of AIPAC.\u201d The crucial fight, though, was in the Senate. A couple of days before the Christmas recess, Robert Menendez and Mark Kirk introduced their sanctions bill, the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013. At first, senators were eager to express support\u2014previous Iran-sanctions bills had passed by votes of 99\u20130\u2014and, by the second week of January, Menendez and Kirk had secured the votes of fifty-nine senators, including sixteen Democrats. One more vote would enable the bill\u2019s supporters to overcome a filibuster. A number of senators facing re\u00eblection were told by AIPAC contacts that fund-raisers would be cancelled if they did not sign on, according to several employees of another lobby. (AIPAC denies this.) In January, though, AIPAC\u2019s effort stalled. Some senators complained that the bill called for immediate sanctions. In fact, a close reading of the bill makes plain that most of the sanctions would become active ninety days after enactment. But the sanctions, ostensibly intended to put pressure on the Iranian negotiators, were designed to go into effect automatically, no matter how the nuclear talks went. The bill also dictated to negotiators the acceptable terms of an agreement, and committed the U.S. to support any defensive military action that Israel took against Iran. On the Senate floor, Dianne Feinstein gave a pointed speech, in which she warned that, if the bill passed, \u201cdiplomatic negotiations will collapse,\u201d and said, \u201cWe cannot let Israel determine when and where the United States goes to war.\u201d Ten Senate committee chairmen\u2014including Feinstein, who serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence, and Carl Levin, of Michigan, the head of the Armed Services Committee\u2014wrote to Harry Reid, noting that the intelligence community believed that new sanctions would effectively halt the negotiations. At the same time, AIPAC was urging Reid to bring the measure to a vote\u2014and, as the former congressional aide noted, \u201cyou don\u2019t alienate a key fund-raising base, especially when you may be about to lose the Senate.\u201d But the pressure from the White House was even greater. Brad Gordon, AIPAC\u2019s longtime legislative official, said ruefully, \u201cI have not seen the Administration act with such force and such sustained effort . . . since Obama became President.\u201d At a meeting with several dozen Democratic senators in January, Obama spoke at length about Iran, warning of the possibility of war. Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, said later that the President \u201cwas as good as I\u2019ve ever heard him.\u201d As congressional Democrats continued to meet in the White House Obama\u2019s press secretary, Jay Carney, referred to the proposed sanctions as part of a \u201cmarch to war.\u201d Not long afterward, Bernadette Meehan, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said, \u201cIf certain members of Congress want the United States to take military action, they should be up front with the American public and say so.\u201d Congressional offices were inundated with calls from constituents alarmed by the prospect of war. The decisive moment came in the State of the Union speech, when Obama said plainly, \u201cIf this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.\u201d About a week later, forty-two Republican senators sent a letter to Reid, demanding that he bring Menendez-Kirk to a vote, and noting that he had already \u201ctaken unprecedented steps to take away the rights of the minority in the Senate.\u201d Reid\u2019s staff members urged AIPAC officials to stop pressing for the bill; their office had been open to a bipartisan process, they argued, but siding with the Republicans against Obama was hardly bipartisan. According to a former Senate aide, the lobbyists seemed to realize that if they continued to push they would have to give up any claim to bipartisanship. Two days later, AIPAC issued a statement saying that the time was not right for a vote; Menendez issued a similar statement. \u201cThat was the fundamental moment when Menendez-Kirk lost,\u201d the aide said. AIPAC had sustained a painful defeat\u2014and its annual policy conference was only a few weeks away. The day before the conference, according to a senior House Democrat, \u201cAIPAC still did not have its \u2018ask\u2019 together.\u201d Instead of dictating the terms of legislation, the lobby struggled to negotiate letters to the President, urging him to support sanctions. In the end, Cantor and Hoyer\u2019s resolution was reduced to a letter, circulated in the House, that was so anodyne that most Democrats in the progressive caucus signed it. Some of the House Democrats who had fought against the resolution were enjoying a new sense of confidence. For a month, David Price and his fellow-Democrat Lloyd Doggett had been gathering support for a letter to the President, saying that Congress should \u201cgive diplomacy a chance.\u201d They expected to get perhaps forty signatures. Instead, they got a hundred and four, including those of four Republicans. \u201cAIPAC tried to peel some away, but what\u2019s striking is how few we lost,\u201d Price said. A handful of Jewish members signed, including Jan Schakowsky. Wasserman Schultz did not. \u201cIt was a difficult policy spot for all of us, as Jewish members,\u201d Schakowsky said. But, had the Cantor-Hoyer resolution passed, she continued, \u201cit would have created an atmosphere surrounding the bargaining table that the President could not bargain in good faith. And it would for the first time have dramatically divided the Democrats.\u201d John Yarmuth, of Kentucky, another Jewish member who signed the letter, said, \u201cAIPAC clearly has a great deal of clout in the Republican conference, and many Democrats still think that they have to be responsive to it.\u201d But he believes that the letter was an important measure of congressional restiveness. \u201cI think there is a growing sense among members that things are done just to placate AIPAC, and that AIPAC is not really working to advance what is in the interest of the United States.\u201d He concluded, \u201cWe all took an oath of office. And AIPAC, in many instances, is asking us to ignore it.\u201d A few months later, the Gaza war began, and AIPAC mobilized again. \u201cThere were conference calls, mass e-mails, talking points for the day,\u201d a congressional aide said. \u201cAIPAC activists would e-mail me, with fifteen other AIPAC activists cc\u2019d, and then those people would respond, saying, \u2018I agree entirely with what the first e-mail said!\u2019 \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got those Stuck-in-the-Subway-Listening-to-a-Guy-Massacre-Dylan Blues.\u201d October 25, 2010 Buy a cartoon It didn\u2019t hurt AIPAC\u2019s cause that the enemy was Hamas, whose suicide bombings a decade ago killed hundreds of Israeli civilians, and whose rocket attacks in recent years have terrorized citizens, particularly in southern Israel. As Israel pressed its offensive, and hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed, AIPAC argued, as did Netanyahu, that the casualties came only because Hamas was using human shields. Online, AIPAC posted a short film, \u201cIsrael\u2019s Moral Defense,\u201d which depicted an Israeli major in a quandary. Looking at a schoolyard filled with girls in neat uniforms, he sees fighters with a rocket launcher not far behind them. Should he order his men to fire their machine guns, and risk hitting the girls, or hold back, and risk the rocket killing Israelis? \u201cI didn\u2019t pull the trigger,\u201d the soldier says. \u201cWe are totally different. . . . I am very proud to be in an army that has this level of morality.\u201d A couple of weeks after the film appeared, Israeli shells struck a United Nations school in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing twenty-one people and injuring more than ninety; it was the sixth U.N. school that Israel had bombed. The next day, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, pointed out that, as Israeli forces attacked homes, schools, and hospitals, the U.S. was supplying them with heavy weaponry. Almost simultaneously, the House passed an AIPAC-supported resolution denouncing Hamas\u2019s use of human shields and condemning an inquiry into Israel\u2019s Gaza operations that Pillay was sponsoring. According to congressional staffers, some members of Congress seemed eager to make up for their recent apostasy on the Iran negotiations. While Reid and his colleagues went to extraordinary lengths to fund the Iron Dome missile-defense system, the House leadership engaged in the same mission. The vote in the House came late on the night of Friday, August 1st\u2014the last possible moment before the summer recess. The earlier resolutions that AIPAC had sponsored during the war had passed unanimously, with no record of individual votes, but on this vote the roll was called. (AIPAC sometimes asks congressional leaders to call the roll when a decisive victory seems likely.) \u201cI think AIPAC thought this vote would be one hundred per cent,\u201d Jim Moran, a Democrat from Virginia, said. It was close: out of four hundred and thirty-five members, only eight voted no. Moran, who has been in Congress since 1990, and is retiring this year, was one of four Democrats who voted against the resolution. As a longtime member of the Defense Appropriations Committee, he did not believe that there was any urgent need for the funding. \u201cWe have put about nine hundred million dollars into the Iron Dome,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe know that there are many millions unexpended in Israel\u2019s Iron Dome account. And Israel was to get three hundred and fifty-one million on October 1st, for Iron Dome.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, a freshman Democrat from El Paso, also voted against the funding. \u201cI tried to find him on the floor, but I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Moran said. \u201cI wanted him to switch his vote. Now, he might not have switched it anyway, because\u2014as shocking as it may be\u2014he\u2019s in Congress solely to do what he considers to be the right thing. I\u2019m afraid he may have a tough race in November.\u201d The morning after the vote, O\u2019Rourke e-mailed a local AIPAC activist, Stuart Schwartz, to explain his vote, according to a knowledgeable person. In his explanation, which he also posted on Facebook, he pointed out that he had voted for Iron Dome in the past, and had supported the funds that were scheduled to arrive in October. But, he wrote, \u201cI could not in good conscience vote for borrowing $225 million more to send to Israel, without debate and without discussion, in the midst of a war that has cost more than a thousand civilian lives already, too many of them children.\u201d Within hours, O\u2019Rourke was flooded with e-mails, texts, and calls. The next day, the El Paso Times ran a front-page story with the headline \u201cO\u2019ROURKE VOTE DRAWS CRITICISM.\u201d In the story, Stuart Schwartz, who is described as having donated a thousand dollars to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s previous campaign, commented that O\u2019Rourke \u201cchooses to side with the rocket launchers and terror tunnel builders.\u201d A mass e-mail circulated, reading \u201cThe Following Is Shameful, El Paso Has an Anti-Israel Congressman. . . . Do Not Re\u00eblect Beto O\u2019Rourke.\u201d At the bottom was the address of AIPAC\u2019s Web site, and a snippet of text: \u201cAIPAC is directly responsible for the overwhelming support this legislation received on the Hill. If you are not a member of AIPAC, I strongly recommend that you join. Every dollar helps fund this important work in Congress.\u201d The day that Congress passed the Iron Dome bills happened to be an especially deadly one in Gaza. In the city of Rafah, Israeli troops pursued Hamas fighters with such overwhelming force that about a hundred and fifty Palestinians were killed, many of them women and children. Israel\u2019s critics in the region have been energized. Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator, told me that Congress had sent a clear message by funding Iron Dome that day. \u201cCongress was telling Israel, \u2018You go ahead and kill, and we will fund it for you.\u2019 \u201d She argued that Israelis had dominated American political discourse on the war, as they have for decades on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \u201cThey say, \u2018The Palestinians are all terrorists, they are the people we don\u2019t know, they are alien, foreign, strange\u2014but Israelis are like us.\u2019 Who shaped the presentation, in the U.S.? AIPAC, to a large degree.\u201d Yet the war has broad support in Israel. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, just six per cent of the Jewish population believes that the Israeli Army has used excessive force. Of those who expressed an opinion, almost half believe that the force has not been severe enough. The left, finding itself increasingly isolated, is deeply critical of AIPAC. Zeev Sternhell, a leading Israeli intellectual and an expert on European fascism, told me, \u201cI consider AIPAC\u2019s role to have been absolutely disastrous, because it prevents any possibility to move with the Palestinians. We cannot move without American intervention\u2014but we are more or less free of American intervention. This is AIPAC\u2019s job. So the present coalition has this sentiment of impunity.\u201d In the U.S., the war has created tense disagreement, dividing left and right, young and old. Congress showed no such uncertainty, which is a triumph for AIPAC. But the lobby also faces an inevitable question about the extent to which young liberals like O\u2019Rourke represent the future. When I asked Dore Gold, an external adviser to the Netanyahu government, about AIPAC\u2019s prospects, he spoke in determinedly upbeat tones, dismissing the Iran-sanctions episode. \u201cA political loss does not necessarily mean that a political organization has reached its sunset years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the contrary, it can give added motivation for people who are concerned with the implications of Iran crossing the nuclear threshold.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cwhen issues become so partisan, it is harder for an organization like AIPAC. You have to fight that.\u201d For decades, AIPAC has maintained a hugely successful model, creating widespread support from an unlikely base, and tapping into a seemingly endless wellspring of support from the American Jewish community. But bipartisanship is a relic now, and a generation of unquestioning adherents is aging. Like its embattled allies in Congress, AIPAC needs to reach constituents who represent the country as it will look in the coming decades. At AIPAC\u2019s policy conference last March, Olga Miranda, the president of S.E.I.U. Local 87, gazed out at the crowd that filled the darkened Washington Convention Center\u2014a gathering she dubbed the \u201cJewish Super Bowl.\u201d Large video screens displayed her image. A lively woman with long black hair and a commanding voice, Miranda proclaimed, \u201cI am a union leader, I am Joaquin\u2019s mother, I am one of nine children raised by a single mother, I am a Chicana\u2014and I am AIPAC!\u201d For years, she explained, her information about the Middle East had come from television, and she sympathized with the Palestinians, until one day she got a call from someone at AIPAC who asked her if she\u2019d be interested in a trip to Israel. That trip changed her life, she said. Now she argues about Israel with her friends and colleagues. \u201cSee you on the picket lines!\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a comedy, so I\u2019ve had Steve, here, red-flag the funny parts.\u201d December 22, 2003 Buy a cartoon \u201cThe face of pro-Israel activists has changed pretty dramatically,\u201d David Victor, a former AIPAC president, told me. In the past eight years, AIPAC has reached out to Hispanics, African-Americans, and evangelical Christians, in the hope that greater diversity will translate into continued support in Congress. Victor pointed out that this year\u2019s AIPAC conference was bigger than ever. In 2008, when he was president, eight thousand members attended; this year, there were fourteen thousand, including two hundred and sixty student-government presidents. \u201cThese are future opinion leaders,\u201d he said. Those opinion leaders face a difficult task when they return to campus. Many young American Jews believe that criticism is vital to Israel\u2019s survival as a democratic state. Some are even helping to support a campaign known as B.D.S., for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, which is aimed at ending the occupation and recognizing the rights of Palestinian refugees and citizens. In June, the U.S. branch of the Presbyterian church voted to divest from three companies seen as profiting from the military occupation of the West Bank. (One was Caterpillar, the construction-equipment company, which Rachel Corrie\u2019s parents had sued, unsuccessfully.) The church took care to affirm Israel\u2019s right to exist and to disavow an endorsement of the B.D.S. movement. J Street, likewise, has said that B.D.S. can be \u201ca convenient mantle for thinly disguised anti-Semitism.\u201d But the movement persists, particularly on campuses and in left-wing circles. Ironically, there is also a threat to AIPAC from the right. Many American conservatives were enraged by the perception that AIPAC had surrendered in the fight for Iran sanctions. Shortly after Menendez set aside his efforts to pass the bill, AIPAC issued a statement vowing to try again later. \u201cThey did that because there was an eruption from the other side,\u201d a former Senate aide said. \u201c \u2018How could you sell out the Republican caucus, when we were advocating exactly what Bibi Netanyahu was!\u2019 \u201d Republicans were frustrated by the lobby\u2019s refusal to move forward at the expense of Democrats, the aide said: \u201cI know AIPAC has its commitment to bipartisanship. But what good is that commitment if in the end you don\u2019t achieve your policy objective?\u201d For AIPAC\u2019s most severe conservative critics, its attempts to occupy a diminishing sliver of middle ground are unacceptable. Recently, Sheldon Adelson, who funded AIPAC\u2019s new office building a few years ago, has been increasing his support for the right-wing Zionist Organization of America. Mort Klein, the head of the Z.O.A., told me, \u201cAdelson is not happy with AIPAC, clearly.\u201d Several people affiliated with the right-wing Jewish movement told me that significant donors are talking about founding a new organization. Caught between the increasingly right-leaning Israel and the increasingly fractious United States, AIPAC has little space to maneuver. Wittmann, the spokesman, said, \u201cOur positions in support of the Oslo process and the two-state solution have generated criticism from some on the right, just as our stand for strong prospective Iran sanctions has spurred criticism from some on the left\u201d\u2014a statement of bipartisan intent, but also of the difficulty of contemporary politics. Recently, the lobby has begun another outreach effort, focussed on progressive Democrats. At the conference, Olga Miranda and Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 Presidential campaign, spoke on a panel called \u201cThe Progressive Case for Israel.\u201d Lewis told me that she has recently been involved in conversations with AIPAC staff and board members about finding ways to improve AIPAC\u2019s connections with progressive Democrats. \u201cThey are exploring how to reach progressives, but they\u2019re lost on this!\u201d a leader in the pro-Israel community who is knowledgeable about the effort said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to bridge the gap. People see AIPAC as representing issues that are anathema to them. It\u2019s an enormous challenge.\u201d At the conference, the extent of the challenge was clear. Even Netanyahu seemed struck by the mood. At one point in his speech, he said, \u201cI hope that the Palestinian leadership will stand with Israel and the United States on the right side of the moral divide, the side of peace, reconciliation, and hope.\u201d The audience members responded with scant, listless applause. \u201cYou can clap,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u2666 * An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Jan Schakowsky\u2019s campaigns received funding from the AIPAC organization.

They come in the form of historic-house museums and local parks, community gardens and churchyards -- places where weary city dwellers and visitors can slip in for a quick sip of nature, or linger through an afternoon. \nWith the summer season over, and winter\u2019s limited palette of grays and whites on the way, there is perhaps no better time to discover the hidden gardens of New York.

Though private, the garden is generally open from 8 a.m. to dusk, and recently, couples and solitary New Yorkers who brought books or knitting occupied the benches there. \nThe southwest orientation makes for a milder microclimate. Four quadrants, delineated by slate paths, are filled with perennials and annuals in shades of pink, white, blue and lavender. Especially beautiful are the large, vigorous rose bushes, in vivid fuchsia, just inside the entrance at the corner of Barrow Street.

Rockefeller Jr., Fort Tryon Park contains the three-acre Heather Garden, the largest public garden with unrestricted access in the city. The garden has one of the most significant collections of heaths and heathers \u2013 small, colorful shrubs more typical of Scotland \u2013 on the East Coast. \nRockefeller acquired the land, which sits on a rocky bluff 200 feet above the Hudson River in Upper Manhattan, and then commissioned the Olmsted Brothers (sons of master landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted) to design the park and its gardens. Every season puts on a different show, and the Heather Garden, dense and lush, is now teeming with oak-leaf hydrangea, white wood aster, autumn crocus and blue mistflower, among dozens of other flowers.

The plot is named for the tiny knoll at its center, but it also sits in the shadow of a Russian Orthodox church, whose large domes rise across North 12th Street. \nGreen Dome Garden was established by a group of neighborhood volunteers in the late 1990s. It is open mostly on weekends, when families shopping at the nearby farmers' market stop in with their children to explore the Belgian block paths lined with delicate ferns, drifts of ivy, towering stalks of pampas grass and lilac-hued butterfly bushes. \n\u201cThe phlox are still around now, and the asters are coming into their own,\u201d said Amir Yarkoni, a florist who helped create the garden.

Called the Splaza (a combination of plaza and splash), the spray showers, along with an adjacent amusement park with small rides, opened last year and have become a popular play space. \nBut surrounding the Splaza are verdant lawns and carefully curated plantings that will please those seeking a quieter experience. \nSince the Splaza is next to Raritan Bay, gardeners from the city\u2019s parks department chose wind- and salt-tolerant plants like beach rose, black-eyed Susan, amaranth and salt bush. Recently, dragonflies and monarch butterflies flitted about, while a wild turkey, with seven chicks in tow, ambled through the flower beds.

One of those gardens is nestled in a modest neighborhood in Jamaica, Queens, where the rapper Curtis Jackson, known as 50 Cent, grew up. \nMr. Jackson\u2019s G-Unity Foundation helped finance the garden\u2019s renovation in 2008. The small space was efficiently designed with an eye toward form and function. \nLong benches offer ample seating to enjoy the red trumpet vine that cascades from a wooden arbor at the garden\u2019s entrance, as well as clumps of agastache, or \u201cblue fortune,\u201d with their spiky flowers in a dazzling violet-blue. \nThere are also pear and apple trees, vegetable plots and a children\u2019s garden. Ten-foot-tall funnels provide shade and capture rainwater to irrigate the garden. Photo Credit Kirsten Luce for The New York Times The Bronx Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum \nThe garden at the Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum in the Bronx is a study in formality. Terraced lawns descend from the Greek Revival house museum to a reflecting pool, where four bluestone paths come together. In the center is a bronze cupid grasping a fish, water spouting from its mouth. \nWhite hibiscus, mauve hydrangeas and diminutive evergreens line the stone walls and wrought-iron fence that enclose the garden. \nThe property, now part of Pelham Bay Park, once belonged to the Pell family, which bought 50,000 acres in 1654 from the Lenape Indians. The current house, which is being restored, was built by Robert Bartow, a Pell descendant, in the mid-1800s. \nNew York City bought the property in the late 1880s and eventually leased it to the International Garden Club on the condition that the group restore the house and open the grounds to the public. The prominent architecture firm of Delano & Aldrich created the formal gardens in 1916. \nThe Bartow-Pell Conservancy (formerly the International Garden Club) began restoring the gardens a few years ago. \u201cIt was a bit jungly,\u201d said Ellen M. Bruzelius, executive director of the Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum. \u201cThe original plans from Delano & Aldrich are long gone. We created plant beds that we knew had been there from photographs.\u201d More on NYTimes.com ",

      "text": "Questions and Answers \nTired of the crazy politics and government interference or social permissiveness? Has your tax burden become more than you can bear? If you've ever thought that if people just did it your way, things would be much better...we have good news: you can start your own micronation! It's not easy, but it's also not impossible, and we'll show you how to do it. We'll also show you some successes, some failures, and the very real future of nation building. Ad Steps 1 Learn about your country. It makes sense to learn about your country before you go off making a new one. 2 Make your plans. Write what it's name is, The capital(s), State or province names, Language(s). You can think about it.If possible make a custom National flag, song(s), anthem(s), symbol(s). 3 Know the rules. As Bob Dylan said, \"to live outside the law you must be honest.\" The same thought holds true for forming a micronation: to make your own rules you must follow established rules and conventions. Much of the basis for current nation building comes from the 1933 Convention on Rights and Duties of States , also known as the Montevideo Convention. [1] These are the basic rules set out in Article 1 of the Convention: The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications : A permanent population Government The capacity to enter into relations with the other states The balance of the first ten Articles go on to explain that the existence of a state is independent of recognition by other states, and is free to act on its own behalf\u2014and that no state is free to intervene in the affairs of another. Note that these are not laws in the conventional sense. You are free to declare yourself a country, anytime, and anywhere. However, nobody will take you seriously, which translates to the simple truth that you will have no legitimacy as a nation. 4 Find territory for your micronation. This is the hard part. With two exceptions, existing land has all been claimed by existing countries. The main exception is Antarctica. Even then, should you brave the weather and lack of \"population appeal,\" Antarctica is managed by the most powerful countries in the world, and it's unlikely they'll let you just plant a flag and say, \"Mine!\" Second, there is Bir Tawil, a tiny plot of land between Egypt and Sudan, which neither claim. However, there is very little appeal to this country, due to it being only a patch of sand. Also, it has been \"claimed\" by Jeremiah Heaton, and is referred to as North Sudan. [2] Still, there are things to try, to get around this earth of available dirt: Conquer an existing country. There are many small island nations dotting the Pacific, and it's unlikely they have much of a defense force. Sure, it's crazy\u2014but crazy enough that it might just work! All you need is an army, a navy, and the support of the world community\u2014many of whom protect these small nations from intruders. This has been attempted in the Comoros, Vanuatu, and the Maldives, but ultimately failed. [3] Buy an existing country. If you're wealthy enough, you can buy an island , though it's unlikely that the host nation will just cede sovereignty to you. A more corrupt or destitute country might be more easily swayed, but even that is difficult: a pack of libertarians tried to buy Tortuga from impoverished Haiti, but were rejected. There are some things money just can't buy. Find a loophole. The Republic of Indian Stream, for example, was founded on land between the U.S. and Canada that was poorly defined in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. It lasted from 1832 to 1835, when it was annexed by the U.S. Look for regions that are otherwise unproductive for the local government. Chances are that the local authority won't have any interest in keeping a disputed, resource consuming territory that is otherwise economically/politically unproductive. At this point, you might be thinking there's no hope, but we've saved the best for last. As land has become scarce, but the human need for new land continues apace, creative (and financially abundant) individuals have begun taking to the sea. 5 Build an island. The ocean, as they say, is the last great frontier. International waters are owned by no nation, and this has spurred interest and activity. The Principality of Sealand . Sealand, initially created as a military base in the North Sea, off the coast of England during World War II, is a football-field-sized structure that housed troops and weapons to strike at German invaders. After the war it was abandoned until 1966, when a rogue DJ named Roy Bates\u2014tired of battling the British government over his pirate radio station\u2014moved there to set up shop. The station never went back on the air, but he declared the floating fortress the Principality of Sealand. He raised the flag, named himself Prince, and his wife Princess Joan. Sealand withstood court challenges, and remains an independent nation to this day. Palm Island Group . While not a nation, the Palm Island Group off the coast of Dubai is indicative of the direction that holds the most promise for nation builders. Extending out into the Persian Gulf are 3 palm tree-shaped man-made islands that opulent living for the world's millionaires and billionaires. The Seasteading Institute . Founded by the grandson of Milton Friedman and PayPal founder Peter Thiel, this would-be libertarian utopian foundation believes in bringing the free market to bear on government\u2014a start-up for democracy. Their hope is that experimental, innovated governments will be able to generate new ideas of governance that will change the world. They are fostering the goal of building sea-based platforms with loose building requirements, no minimum wage, and limited restrictions on firearms. Proponents see this as a the key to the next generation of free enterprise. Critics suggest that loose building codes and low-wage workers with lots of weapons, being run by a bunch of would-be John Galts as a recipe for disaster. While the politics of the Seasteading Institute may or may not be your cup of tea, it's a fair bet that the ocean is truly the new frontier. The Republic of Minerva . One millionaire activist piled sand onto a reef located in the Pacific Ocean south of Fiji and created an artificial island to start the Republic of Minerva. [4] But if you're not rich enough to make land, then just make it up\u2014some of the more lighthearted micronations claim land on imaginary continents or planets. In addition to the traditional territory-based nation, there exists a largely untapped, unregulated, and unexplored territory that is virtually limitless\u2014because it exists only virtually. Call it the cloud, call it the web, or borrow from William Gibson and call it cyberspace, people are spending more and more time connected emotionally and interactively with their friends and colleagues through the internet. Virtual worlds such as Second Life and Blue Mars create 3-dimensional habitats, have their own currency, and their own constitutions (aka \"Terms and Conditions\"). Flatter worlds such as Facebook (aka Social Media) encourages groups of like-minded people around the world to work together for the common good\u2014as defined by the particular group. Like the ocean, virtual nations will have a growing impact, and may result in very real, separate national identities within the next 100 years. 6 Invite your friends. One of the key requirements for a nation\u2014aside from territories\u2014will be a population. If the land you conquer or build doesn't come with an indigenous people, you will have to bring your own to the party. Invite your friends and family to join you in this venture, and you will have a small, but dedicated population. These days, if you're serious about anything (and creating a micronation can be serious, indeed), then you will have a website. Use this to find like-minded people, and give them good reason to populate your new Republic. It could be for work and money, or the freedom to have many wives, or simply the opportunity to be part of the birth of a nation. You will need to decide what you require of your citizens. Do they have to pass a citizenship test, or abide by certain laws? What form of identification will they need\u2014a passport? Driver's license? Subcutaneous RFID? 7 Establish a government and a constitution. The success or failure of your venture will be determined, in large part, by your leadership in governance. Consider the success of the United States, rooted in a Constitution that is at once clear and defined, yet open to interpretation and growth. Without that, it may have fallen into disarray and dozens of small nation-states rather than an arguably united whole. Your government, and your constitution, should be guided by the principles you wish to establish from the start. Here are some examples of various micronations, and their founding principles: Nova Roma , dedicated \"to the restoration of classical Roman religion, culture and virtues\". [5] The American Empire , based on a strong sense of humor and a love of science fiction, fantasy, and games. [6] Political simulations or political movements. These micronations tend to have strong political views and are often controversial. In the past, some of them have managed to attract media or political interest, although this is rare. Despite their relative obscurity, they are some of the most common types of micronations. Cultural missions . These micronations, similar to historic projects, exist to promote a particular culture and tradition. There are many Germanic micronations such as Domanglia that attempt to recreate the culture and traditions of the former German Empire. Many of these also include nationalistic and patriotic projects. Secessionist entities . By far the most serious form of micronation, secessionist entities are often much older then other forms of micronations. Notable secessionist micronations include Sealand, the Hutt River Province, and Freetown Christinia. 8 Declare your independence. Now that you have territory, a population, and a government with a constitution, it's time to declare yourself. One of three things will happen, depending on what you have prepared for the world: A collective yawn. The world may look at your declaration of independence, and promptly go back to watching a rerun of Star Trek. A welcome into the community of nations, an invitation to a seat at the UN, and requests for ambassadors and embassies. An armed invasion. If your nation runs afoul of borders, existing treaties, human rights, or other legal protocols, you may receive anything from a knock at the door by Rent-a-Cop Officer Friendly informing you that the \"Independent Nation of 1234 N. Raynd Avenue\" is in a covenant-controlled community that does not recognize your sovereignty, and that you must to take your flag off the roof or be fined, to an all-out invasion by a United Nations coalition ordering you to stand down and please get into the bullet-proof Mercedes SUV, where you will be whisked off to The Hague to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Alternatively, your micronation could suffer the same fate as the Republic of Minerva: soon after libertarian millionaire and activist Michael Oliver created a landmass by pouring sand onto the Minerva Reefs south of Fiji, and subsequently proclaimed sovereignty, the island was invaded and annexed (with international support) by Tonga. [7] 9 Establish an economy. If you're not trading in dollars, Euros, or other currency, you will need to create your own financial system. Will you base your nation's wealth on gold, on securities, or on a whim and a prayer? While your word may count among your friends, for national debt, you will need some serious collateral for that to be of any use. If you stick to established currencies, you will still need to determine how to fund your government, and the best way to do this may be anathema to the very reason you start your own country: taxes. Through taxation, your government will be able to provide essential services such as a power grid, water lines, a necessary bureaucracy (as minimal as you like), and an army. It's a fundamental obligation for every state (small or large) to be able to defend its citizens from enemies. Whether this is a standing army, national guard, compulsory service, or some other defensive solution, this will be something to consider when creating your constitution. 10 Be recognized by the world community. Barring any untoward issues resulting from the founding of your country (see above), you will want to become a player in the world. To do this, you will need other nations to recognize you. This will require you to become adept at international law, politics, and diplomacy. If these are not among your strongest skills, you would be wise to recruit a cabinet of skilled politicos to take on this task. This is perhaps the most difficult step of all. Some nations, such as Palestine, Taiwan, and Northern Cyprus have all the checkboxes checked\u2014but are still not recognized by many countries. There are no rules here\u2014every country has their own standards by which they determine recognition. Things that could have an effect on the outcome are issues such as where you stand on Al Queda, or communism, or capitalism. They might hinge on your approach to human rights, or control of natural resources. In the United States, the decision to recognize a nation is made by the President. Your request will hinge on who occupies the White House at that time, and their policies and preferences may swing wildly every four years. Also, membership to the UN requires that none of the five powers US, UK, China, Russia and France veto your membership. In other words, you will have to have neutral stands on controversial issues like Palestine, Taiwan, Crimea, etc. If you live near or in Europe, try applying for membership to the European Union as well. This will ensure your sovereignty in world politics. 11 Manage your branding. Every country needs a flag, of course, and yours will be no different. This is the most prominent of national symbols, but there are other symbols that will help establish your identity as a nation: Money . What will your currency look like? Will it have your profile boldly embossed on gold coins, and in 3D hologram on paper money, or will you use a symbolic icon such as Lady Liberty or Charlton Heston? Will you go full-tilt modern, or attempt to hearken back to a time when each piece was carved by hand? State Seal . You can come up with a national motto and translate it into Latin. There are many free online translators. Add some florid graphics with a shield, all to suggest you're descended from royalty\u2014or you can state your mission clearly in your own language, and have a graphic designer create a logo. A good logo can be worth more than the crown jewels of England! Official correspondence . With all the letters you'll be writing to the President, the UN, the Prime Minister, and other heads of state, you'll want nice letterhead on high quality paper, embossed with your seal. National Anthem . You'll want a national anthem to play at important events. 12 Get out there and do it! The world isn't getting any bigger, and governments aren't getting any smaller (no matter what they promise), so the sooner you get out there and stake your claim. The sooner you can declare yourself Prince, King, Emperor, Ayatollah, Supreme Ruler, and President for Life of [insert your imperial dynasty here]. Reader Questions and Answers ",

By Edu Bayer Alhen Mayfren and Belkys Mata pose for a picture at Pabell\u00f3n Cuba. She is an accountant from Venezuela and came to Cuba on vacation for a couple of weeks. Mayfren is dancer and actor, and he is currently preparing a street show in Old Havana for the \"Habana Vieja: Ciudad en Movimiento\" festival. A view of downtown Vedado district from the roof of the Prince building. In the background is the Hotel Habana Libre, the former Hilton Hotel before the Cuban revolution. A teenaged couple at the Malec\u00f3n, an esplanade that runs for a five-mile stretch along the coast of Havana. A popular spot, this balcony to the sea offers relief from the noisy city. Concrete Soviet-style building in Alamar, a Havana suburb, that was converted into the Centro de Arte de Alamar, Habana del Este. Alamar, developed in the 1970s with the help of the former Soviet Union, is one of the biggest housing projects in Cuba and is now in decay. Alamar is also seen by many as the birthplace of Cuban hip hop. Twenty-two-year-old Shellys Mayara is a second-year student at the ISA (Instituto Superior de Arte), but she also works as an actress and model. \"I am lucky to be very busy working as an actress, makeup artist, and model.\" She says she\u2019s going to take part in a U.S.-Mexican horror movie, soon to be filmed at the border. A group of kids has come to the Malec\u00f3n after an afternoon of street soccer. Hot, they abandoned their game to jump into the cool water, when a guard came to fine them. For years, it has been forbidden to swim in the Malec\u00f3n. The authorities do not permit it because of the water pollution and the risks of swimming near the reefs and rocks. Harlyn Ramos, 26, is a jazz, fusion, and Cuban music percussionist. A native of Havana, he grew up in the neighborhood of La Ceiba. Now, he lives in St. Petersburg, Russia, with his wife but is back in Cuba to see his family. He carries his iPhone in his pocket, a luxury few of his Cuban friends can afford. Damarys Benavides consoles her friend, Claudia, who is having problems with her boyfriend, at the entrance of Pabell\u00f3n Cuba, one of the most important spots in the youth culture scene; it is the only place where there are free concerts every day, and youngsters go to drink coffee, sodas, beers, and rum. Cristobal, 22, is graduate of fine arts and is now working as a tattoo artist in Pinar del R\u00edo. Though the practice is still largely illegal, making it difficult to import the necessary equipment (needles, sterilizers, and ink), the fondness for tattoos is growing. Recent reforms have not formally legalized the activity, although the first official tattoo studio recently opened and is attached to an urban art gallery in Havana. Kids line up at the legendary ice-cream parlor, Coppelia, known as the \u201cice-cream cathedral.\u201d A project of the communist government, it was built in 1966 in the city center of Havana. Its advent was marked by whimsy and splendor, offering 26 flavors of ice cream. Today, due to a shortage of products, Coppelia only serves one flavor a day, but still thousands of people come every day, waiting upwards of two hours in line. A scoop of ice cream costs 2 Cuban pesos (8 cents USD). Monica Molt\u00f3, a telecommunications student in Havana, at a cafe trying to connect to the Internet. Empty rum bottles. Traces of last night at the Malec\u00f3n in the morning. This is a popular place that in the afternoon, evening, and night is filled with couples and groups of friends having fun. There are all sorts of stories, always accompanied by rum, beer, and cigarettes. Ernesto Mesa, 21, a visual artist from Guanabacoa, is part of a skater groupfrom Paseo Prado. He no longer owns his own skateboard, but he keeps going out every day with his gang. A self-taught, aspiring artist, Mesa would love to pursue an art history degree. Though both his parents have jobs, they don\u2019t have the money to spend on tuition. \u201cI love doing stencils,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I cannot afford the sprays.\u201d A fan of American music, his hairstyle is a tribute to Jimi Hendrix. Young people enjoy beers at Pabell\u00f3n Cuba. The price of a beer in a Havana bar ranges from $1 to $2.50. Pabell\u00f3n Cuba is an important place in Cuba\u2019s youth culture scene. In the afternoon and into early evening, there is a small bar that serves coffee and drinks, and bands play music. William Montano is a new cuentapropista (an entrepreneur), selling telephone cards in Vedado. The 27-year-old used to be a fisherman, but now he works full time with his new business. He still fishes on Sundays at the Malec\u00f3n. In addition to the money he makes with phones, he sells his weekly catch -- 4 to 6 pounds of fish. A common scene in Cuba: men playing Parcheesi on a street in downtown Havana. Domino and Parcheesi have been the most popular games in the neighborhoods of Havana. The youth of today are exchanging those habits for video games and mobiles. Javier Marine, 20, is one of three guards who watch over the new headquarters of the French Lyceum school in central Havana, inaugurated last month by the president of France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. \u201cThank God I have not had problems, because Cubans are not problematic at all,\u201d Marine says referring to the relative lack of violence in Cuba. He hopes to someday study computer science. The first free Wi-Fi Internet in Cuba, at the Kcho art studio in El Romerillo. Dozens of young people came with their computers and phones to connect, but the network was saturated with users, and no one was able to connect. Fabian Lopez is the 18-year-old leader of the skater group from Paseo Prado. He studied English and makes his living mostly as a tattoo artist. \u201cHavana is very good for skating,\u201d he says. But the police often get in the way. \u201cI have about 50 pending fines of 100 Cuban pesos ($4) each, but I do not have the money.... They all are fines for skating under the law of social indiscipline.\u201d He acknowledges that the skill level is not as high here in Cuba as it is elsewhere in the global skating community. But, he says, \u201cI do not say that because I dislike my country, in fact, I have this island on my arm,\u201d he says, holding up his arm to reveal it. \u201cIt was my first tattoo.\u201d David Perez Laza, 40, Leo Canosa, 40, and Mauro Coca, 23, are tattoo artists at La Marca, which opened in January 2015. This business was not possible a short time ago. \nMonica Molt\u00f3 sits on a small boat-shaped brick bench, the work of artist Alexis Leyva Machado, known as Kcho. The people scattered around her are busy with their laptops, tablets, and computers. She is one of the dozens of young people patiently trying to connect to the first free Wi-Fi Internet in Cuba at the Kcho art studio in El Romerillo. \nMolt\u00f3, 18, is a telecommunications student in Havana. \n\u201cIn college, we fix payphones and old machines,\u201d Molt\u00f3 says as she holds an iPhone in one hand and checks her laptop with the other. Sporting a tight printed T-shirt and big retro sunglasses, Molt\u00f3 wears her dyed hair short and has a small piercing in her nose. Referring to school, she says that much of the work they do \u201cis all very theoretical, because we have very few computers and almost no Internet.\u201d \nAfter a half hour, Molt\u00f3 gives up on trying to load her Facebook page, though the rest of the young faces around her still appear engrossed in their browser screens waiting to connect. They, like Molt\u00f3, are part of Cuba\u2019s millennial generation, a group of young people who no longer identify with their country\u2019s revolutionary ideology. They are not as vested in politics nor are they interested in working for the state for a monthly wage of roughly $15 to $20. \nMolt\u00f3 was 11 years old when Fidel Castro resigned power, and she does not remember his now notoriously long speeches, in which he railed against the United States and harangued the Cuban people listening with his ideas about socialism. Neither does she remember Cuba\u2019s links to the USSR, the hard Per\u00edodo Especial, and when the famous Coppelia ice-cream shop had more than one flavor per day. The Cuban revolution is something that she studied in school and is little more than that to her now -- something that happened long ago. It is not a part of her. \nNowadays, however, in her Cuba -- despite most of the population still working for the state -- the biggest part of the people\u2019s salary is the black market, especially in the cities. The system doesn\u2019t work anymore. There is a funny sentence that many people like to repeat: \u201cThe state pretends to pay us, and we pretend to work.\u201d \nShe is part of a growing and ambitious creative collective -- young musicians, designers, dancers, actors, and artists -- who lack material wealth but are now seeking their place in the alternative (private) scene outside the official proceedings. \nCuban millenials have a more Western mentality; they want stuff, they want to look good, to have fun, and to be able to have the freedom to pursue grander ambitions -- financial and otherwise. \nThey want more.

      "text": "Bernie Sanders on Monday heralded his convincing win over Hillary Clinton in the Democrats Abroad global primary as proof that his \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d was now \u201cresonating all over the world\u201d.\nRelated: Clinton ends Aipac speech by calling Trump a 'bully' \u2013 campaign live \nWith turnout up 50% from 2008, 34,570 US citizens living in 38 countries voted by internet, mail, fax or in person. Sanders took 69% of the vote to earn nine delegates to the national convention in August; Hillary Clinton took 31% and four.\nSanders has won nine US states so far, but in a count including the party\u2019s sometimes controversial independent superdelegates , he trails Clinton by 1,614 delegates to 856.\n\nIn a statement greeting his win with Democrats living abroad, Sanders said: \u201cThis political revolution that is gaining momentum across America is now resonating all over the world.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear path to victory as we begin the second half of the delegate selection process. We are waging a strong campaign and plan to take it all the way to the Democratic National Convention this summer in Philadelphia.\u201d\nClinton won all five states that voted last week. The next Democratic votes on the US mainland are in Arizona, Utah and Idaho on Tuesday: 131 delegates are on offer. \nWhile Clinton started Monday speaking at the pro-Israel Aipac conference in Washington DC, Sanders \u2013 who on Sunday admitted to having been \u201c creamed \u201d by Clinton in southern states but predicted gains out west \u2013 was campaigning in those western states. He was not scheduled to address Aipac.\nAlaska, Hawaii and Washington will hold caucuses on Saturday, with 142 delegates at stake.\n\u201cDA volunteers worked around the clock and around the world over the past two weeks to verify and count every ballot cast,\u201d said Democrats Abroad international secretary Julia Bryan, in a statement .\nRelated: Bernie Sanders: Clinton 'creamed us' in south but west coast will be better \nDemocrats Abroad also provided vote tallies from countries around the world. In Afghanistan, for example, seven Democrats cast votes: two were for Clinton and five for Sanders.\nOne of Australia\u2019s 873 Democratic voters supported the former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, who dropped out of the race last month . Sanders won 635 Australian votes and Clinton 237. Sanders also won a landslide in Japan, 1178-176, and took handy wins in Mexico (838-545) and Russia (48-17).\nThe UK had the most voting Democrats of any country, with 4,610. Of those, 2,874 favoured Sanders.",

      "text": "By Post Opinions Staff March 21 at 6:04 PM Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump visited the editorial board of The Washington Post on Mar. 21. Here is audio of the full, unedited interview. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) FREDERICK RYAN JR., WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER: Mr. Trump, welcome to the Washington Post. Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board.\nDONALD TRUMP: New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it.\nRYAN: Thank you\u2026 We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly\u2026 Any you can share with us?\nTRUMP: Well, I hadn\u2019t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names\u2026 Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he\u2019s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that\u2019s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that\u2019s a representative group.\nFRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Do you want to start out?\nTRUMP: No, other than to say, we\u2019re working hard, I think we\u2019re all in the same business of trying to make our country better, a better place, so we have something in common. I\u2019ve been treated very, very badly by The Washington Post, but, you know, I guess \u2014 and I\u2019m your neighbor, I\u2019m your neighbor right down the road, in fact we\u2019re actually giving a press conference there in a little while, I think your people are going to be there. And by the way, Bob Costa is an excellent reporter, I\u2019ve found him to be just an excellent reporter. I should tell you, because I have to give you the good and the bad. Not that he does me any favors, because he doesn\u2019t, but he\u2019s a real professional.\nSo we\u2019re having a news conference today in the new building that\u2019s going up, and the building is very much ahead of schedule, because it was supposed to open two years from September, and we\u2019re going to open it in September. We could open it actually sooner but we\u2019re going to break it in a little bit, so we\u2019re going to open it in September, and it\u2019s under budget, even though we\u2019ve increased the quality of the finishes substantially, marble finishes, very high quality of marble, so we\u2019re under budget and ahead of schedule. And I\u2019m, you know, I am that way when I build, I know how to build, I know how to get things done.\nThe GSA [General Services Administration], I will say, GSA has been very professional, they\u2019ve been very, very professional. They chose us over\u2014I think they had more than 100 people who bid, you can imagine, because of the location, but they had over 100 people that bid, and it was broken down into ten finalists, and I got it. We got it because of the strength of my financial statement and also because of the strength of what we were proposing. So we\u2019re having a news conference there today. What time is that, Hope?\nHOPE HICKS, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON: It\u2019s at 2:15.\nTRUMP: 2:15. I hear a lot of the press is going to be there, we\u2019re going to give them a tour of the building. It\u2019s still a little bit rough \u2014 as an example, a lot of the marble surfaces all have sheetrock covering, and plywood covering on them, so a lot of people won\u2019t see as much as they think. It\u2019ll be like a miracle, you take it off and it explodes, like it\u2019s finished, right? But that\u2019ll be a fun news conference.\nHIATT: If I could, I\u2019d start by asking is there a secretary of state and a secretary of defense in the modern era who you think have done a good job? Who do you think were the best?\nTRUMP: Well, because I know so many of them, and because in many cases I like them, I hate to get totally involved. I think George Shultz was very good, I thought he was excellent. I can tell you, I think your last secretary of state and your current secretary of state have not done much. I think John Kerry\u2019s deal with Iran is one of the worst things that I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated of any kind. It\u2019s just a horrible giveaway.\nHIATT: What in particular?\nTRUMP: Well, I think, number one, we shouldn\u2019t have given the money back. I think, number two, we should have had our prisoners before the negotiations started. We should have doubled up the sanctions. We should have gone in and said, \u2018release our prisoners,\u2019 they would have said \u2018no,\u2019 and we would have said, \u2018double up the sanctions,\u2019 and within a short period of time we would have had our prisoners back. And I think that was a terrible mistake. I think giving the money back was a terrible mistake. And by the way they are not using the money on us, they are not buying anything from us, they\u2019re buying, you noticed, they didn\u2019t buy Boeing, they bought Airbus, 118 planes from what I understand, but they bought them all from Airbus, they go out of their way not to spend any money in our country. So I wouldn\u2019t have done that. And I think it\u2019s going to just lead, actually, to nuclear problems. I also think it\u2019s going to be bad for Israel. It\u2019s a very bad deal for Israel.\nHIATT: George Shultz, it\u2019s interesting, was associated with a foreign policy of Reagan that was very much devoted to promoting democracy and freedom overseas. Is that something you think in today\u2019s world the United States should be doing?\nTRUMP: I do think it\u2019s a different world today and I don\u2019t think we should be nation building anymore. I think it\u2019s proven not to work. And we have a different country than we did then. You know we have 19 trillion dollars in debt. We\u2019re sitting probably on a bubble and, you know, it\u2019s a bubble that if it breaks is going to be very nasty. And I just think we have to rebuild our country. If you look at the infrastructure \u2014 I just landed at an airport where, not in good shape, not in good shape. If you go to Qatar and if you go to (inaudible) you see airports the likes of which you have never seen before. Dubai, different places in China. You see infrastructure, you see airports, other things, the likes of which you have never seen here.\nHIATT: Short of nation building, is there any role in promoting values or democracy? Or that\u2019s not something\u2026\nTRUMP: Well, there is, I just think that we have values in our country that we have to promote. We have a country that is in bad shape, it\u2019s in bad condition. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a horrible mess. I watched Baltimore, I have many, many friends in Baltimore, we watched what happened. St. Louis, Ferguson, Oakland, it could have been much worse over the summer. And it will probably be worse this summer. But you look at some of our inner cities. And yet you know I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they\u2019d be blown up. And we\u2019d build another one and it would get blown up. And we would rebuild it three times. And yet we can\u2019t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can\u2019t build in our own country. And at what point do you say hey, we have to take care of ourselves. So, you know, I know the outer world exists and I\u2019ll be very cognizant of that but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially in the inner cities.\nHIATT: So what would you do for Baltimore, let\u2019s say.\nTRUMP: Well, number one, I\u2019d create economic zones. I\u2019d create incentives for companies to move in. I\u2019d work on spirit because the spirit is so low, it\u2019s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African American youth, is 58-59 percent. It\u2019s unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans \u2013 not youth, but African Americans \u2013 is very high. And I would create in the inner cities, which is what I really do best, that\u2019s why when I open a building and I show you it\u2019s way ahead of schedule, under budget and everything else\u2014I think it was the Rite Aid store, the store in Baltimore it took them 20 years to get it built, one store, and then it burned down in one night\u2014we have to create incentives for people to love what they are doing, and to make money. And to create, you know, to really create a better life for themselves. And you can\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem right that you will have a situation like Baltimore, and many other places, let\u2019s use Baltimore as an example, there are many Baltimores in this country. Detroit is maybe even a better example than Baltimore. But that you\u2019ll have a situation like that, and then we\u2019re over nation building with other, with countries that in many cases don\u2019t want us there. They want our money, but they don\u2019t want us.\nHIATT: The root of many people\u2019s unhappiness in Baltimore was the perception that blacks are treated differently by law enforcement. And the disproportionate \u2013 do you think it\u2019s a problem that the percentage of blacks in prison is higher than whites, and what do you think is the root of that situation?\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019ve never really see anything that \u2013 you know, I feel very strongly about law enforcement. And, you know, if you look at the riot that took place over the summer, if that were stopped \u2013 it all, it mostly took place on the first evening, and if that were stopped on the first evening, you know, you\u2019d have a much nicer city right now, because much of that damage and much of the destruction was done on Evening One. So I feel that law enforcement, it\u2019s got to play a big role. It\u2019s got to play a big role. But that\u2019s a pretty good example, because tremendous amounts of damage was done that first evening \u2013 first two evenings, but the first evening in particular. And so I\u2019m a very strong believer in law enforcement, but I\u2019m also a very strong believer that the inner cities can come back.\nHIATT: Do you see any racial disparities in law enforcement \u2013 I mean, what set it off was the Freddie Gray killing, as you know. Is that an issue that concerns you?\nTRUMP: Well, look, I mean, I have to see what happens with the trial. I\u2014\nHIATT: Well, forget Freddie Gray, but in general, do you believe there are disparities in law enforcement?\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve read where there are and I\u2019ve read where there aren\u2019t. I mean, I\u2019ve read both. And, you know, I have no opinion on that. Because frankly, what I\u2019m saying is you know we have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people to work. And you know we have lost million and millions of jobs to China and other countries. And they\u2019ve been taken out of this country, and when I say millions, you know it\u2019s, it\u2019s tremendous. I\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs, I\u2019ve seen numbers that range from 6 million to, to smaller numbers. But it\u2019s many millions of jobs, and it\u2019s to countries all over. Mexico is really becoming the new China. And I have great issue with that. Because you know I use in speeches sometimes Ford or sometimes I use Carrier \u2013 it\u2019s all the same: Ford, Carrier, Nabisco, so many of the companies \u2014 they\u2019re moving to Mexico now. And you know we shouldn\u2019t be allowing that to happen. And tremendous unemployment, tremendous. They\u2019re allowing tremendous people that have worked for the companies for a long time, they\u2019re allowing, if they want to move around and they want to work on incentives within the United States, that\u2019s one thing, but when they take these companies out of the United States. Other countries are outsmarting us by giving them advantages, you know, like in the case of Mexico. In the case of many other countries. Like Ireland is, you\u2019re losing Pfizer to Ireland, a great pharmaceutical company that with many, many jobs and it\u2019s going to move to Ireland.\nRUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST: But Mr. Trump, if I could just follow up on Fred\u2019s question. I think that what he was trying to get at was the anger in the African American community that held some of the riots and disturbances this summer about disparate treatment and about \u2026 clearly you say you\u2019ve read where there is disparate treatment. But it is pretty undeniable that there is disproportionate incarceration of African Americans vs. whites. What would you \u2013 is that something that concerns you?\nTRUMP: That would concern me, Ruth. It would concern me. But at the same time it can be solved to a large extant with jobs. You know, if we can rebuild those communities and create incentives for companies to move in and create jobs. Jobs are so important. There are no jobs. There are none. You go to those communities and you can\u2019t \u2013 there is nothing there. There is no incentive for people. It is a very sad situation. And what makes it even sadder is that we are spending so much money in other countries and our own country has vast pockets of poverty and a lot of this is caused by the fact that there are no jobs. So we can create jobs in places like Baltimore and Detroit. You know, Detroit made a move, but I don\u2019t know but it just seems to be fizzling. I don\u2019t know what is going on. I watched Detroit four, five years ago and it looked like they were really putting a full-court press on and it doesn\u2019t seem to be, from what I\u2019ve been told, friends of mine that are very much involved in that whole process that it doesn\u2019t seem to be, doesn\u2019t seem to be something that is being pursued like it should be pursued. But if we can create jobs, it will solve so many problems.\nCHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER/COLUMNIST: Can I follow up on that? I mean, to take the case of Baltimore, I mean one of the things that\u2019s so remarkable about Baltimore and Detroit is that both of these cities, like many others have been \u2013 it\u2019s not as if no one has ever said before we should have economic zones, it\u2019s not as if no one has ever said before we need incentives and taxes etc., etc. And Baltimore received a lot of federal aid over the years. So I guess the question, then, is what\u2019s different specifically about your approach to these issues from what\u2019s been tried in the past, because a lot of effort has been put in just the direction you just described.\nTRUMP: I think what\u2019s different is we have a very divided country. And whether we like it or not, it\u2019s divided as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it. I\u2018ve been, you know, I\u2019ve been doing things for a long time. I see it all the time. I mean I see it so often. I see it when we go out and we have 21,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona, the other day, the division \u2013 not so much Phoenix, because that was actually very smooth, there wasn\u2019t even a minor, they did block a road, but after that, that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division. You can see the division. There\u2019s a racial division that\u2019s incredible actually in the country. I think it\u2019s as bad, I mean you have to say it\u2019s as bad or almost as bad as it\u2019s ever been. And there\u2019s a lack of spirit. And one thing I thought that would happen, and it hasn\u2019t happened, unfortunately, I thought that President Obama would be a great cheerleader for the country. And it just hasn\u2019t happened. I mean we can say it has. But it hasn\u2019t happened. When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems. And you know there\u2019s a lack of spirit. I actually think I\u2019d be a great cheerleader \u2013 beyond other things, the other things that I\u2019d do \u2013 I actually think I\u2019d be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel it\u2019s a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit and that has not taken place. Just has not taken place.\nRYAN: Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve mentioned many times during the campaign, in fact including this morning, instances you feel where the press has been biased or unfair or outright false in their reporting, and you\u2019ve mentioned that you want to \u201copen up\u201d the libel laws. You\u2019ve said that several times.\nTRUMP: I might not have to, based on Gawker. Right?\n[CROSSTALK]\nTRUMP: That was an amazing\u2014\nRYAN: My question is not so much why you feel they should be open but how. What presidential powers and executive actions would you take to open up the libel laws?\nTRUMP: Okay, look, I\u2019ve had stories written about me \u2013 by your newspaper and by others \u2013 that are so false, that are written with such hatred \u2013 I\u2019m not a bad person. I\u2019m just doing my thing \u2013 I\u2019m, you know, running, I want to do something that\u2019s good. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know. This is a very difficult thing to do. In fact I\u2019ve always heard that if you\u2019re a very successful person you can\u2019t run for office. And I can understand that. You\u2019ll do a hundred deals, and you\u2019ll do one bad one or two bad ones \u2014 that\u2019s all they read about are the bad ones. They don\u2019t read about the one hundred and fifty great ones that you had. And even some of the ones they write that are good, they make them sound bad. You know, so I\u2019ve always heard that. I\u2019ve heard that if you\u2019re successful \u2013 very successful \u2013 you just can\u2019t run for\u2014\nRYAN: But how would you fix that? You\u2019ve said that you would open up the libel laws.\nTRUMP: What I would do, what I would do is I\u2019d \u2013 well right now the libel laws, I mean I must tell you that the Hulk Hogan thing was a tremendous shock to me because \u2013 not only the amount and the fact that he had the victory \u2014 because for the most part I think libel laws almost don\u2019t exist in this country, you know, based on, based on everything I\u2019ve seen and watched and everything else, and I just think that if a paper writes something wrong \u2014 media, when I say paper I\u2019m talking about media. I think that they can do a retraction if they\u2019re wrong. They should at least try to get it right. And if they don\u2019t do a retraction, they should, they should you know have a form of a trial. I don\u2019t want to impede free press, by the way. The last thing I would want to do is that. But I mean I can only speak for \u2013 I probably get more \u2013 do I, I mean, you would know, do I get more publicity than any human being on the earth? Okay? I mean, [ Editor\u2019s note: Trump points at Ruth Marcus ] she kills me, this one \u2013 that\u2019s okay, nice woman.\nRYAN: Would you expand, for example, prior restraints against publications?\nTRUMP: No, I would just say this. All I want is fairness. So unfair. I have stories and you have no recourse, you have no recourse whatsoever because the laws are really impotent.\nMARCUS: So in a better world would you be able to sue me?\nTRUMP: In a better world \u2014 no \u2014 in a better world I would be able to get a retraction or a correction. Not even a retraction, a correction.\nRYAN: Well, now, you\u2019ve been a plaintiff in libel suits so you know a little bit of the elements \u2026\nTRUMP: I had one basic big libel suit, it was a very bad system, it was New Jersey. I had a great judge, the first one, and I was going to win it. And then I had another good judge, the second one, and then they kept switching judges. And the third one was a bad judge. That\u2019s what happened. But, uh\u2026\nRYAN: But there\u2019s standards like malice is required. Would you weaken that? Would you require less than malice for news organizations?\nTRUMP: I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, yeah, I think I would get a little bit away from malice without having to get too totally away. Look, I think many of the stories about me are written badly. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s malice because the people don\u2019t know me. When Charles writes about me or when Ruth writes about me, you know, we\u2019ve never really met. And I get these stories and they\u2019re so angry and I actually say, I actually say, \u201cHow could they write?\u201d \u2013 and many stories I must tell you, many stories are written that with a brief phone call could be corrected before they\u2019re written. Nobody calls me.\nSTEPHEN STROMBERG, EDITORIAL WRITER: How are you defining \u201cincorrect?\u201d It seems like you\u2019re defining it as fairness or your view of fairness rather than accuracy.\nTRUMP: Fairness, fairness is, you know, part of the word. But you know, I\u2019ve had stories that are written that are absolutely incorrect. I\u2019ll tell you now and the word \u201cintent\u201d, as you know, is an important word, as you know, in libel. I\u2019ll give you an example. Some of the media, not all of it, but some of it, is very, very strong on \u2013 you know I get these massive crowds of people, and we\u2019ll get protesters. And these protesters are honestly, they\u2019re very bad people. In many cases, they\u2019re professionals. Highly trained professionals. And I will rent an arena for 20,000 seats and they will come in \u2013 because there\u2019s really no way \u2013 how you going to be able to tell \u2013 somebody said \u201coh you shouldn\u2019t let \u2018em in\u201d \u2013 how you gonna know, you know? They walk in. [Inaudible] So we had an incident this weekend, which was amazing in Tucson, Arizona where a man, a protestor, wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit, another one dragging an American flag, was walking out of the arena, and an African American man who was a supporter was sitting there listening to the speech and we had to stop because they were so loud \u2013 they\u2019re so loud, these people, I don\u2019t know what they do, they\u2019re trained voices or something. And they\u2019re walking up and you saw it, because it was all over television, and the African American man became incensed I think the guy said something to him like you know what, like \u201cscrew you,\u201d okay? Or worse. I think, because he looked over to him and said something to him and the guy just had it. Now, they were together, these two. The one wearing a Ku Klux Klan, the other dragging a flag or something, but the African American man, who I think was an Air Force person, I just read he had a pretty stellar life so far. And he just became incensed. So when I saw the television yesterday early in the morning I saw the Ku Klux Klan, I saw exactly what happened. By the time it got on to the national shows that was for the most part taken out. They just had this African American smacking, you know, fighting. And it didn\u2019t make sense, you know, why, why. But if you saw it in the morning it made a lot more sense. We don\u2019t condone violence at all but it\u2019s very, very unfair reporting and we, you know\u2026\nHIATT: Sorry, when you say we don\u2019t condone violence \u2014\nTRUMP: I say that.\nHIATT: You say that. But you\u2019ve also said, \u201cIn the good old days, he would have been ripped out of his seat so fast, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Isn\u2019t that condoning violence?\nTRUMP: No, because what I am referring to is, we\u2019ve had some very bad people come in. We had one guy \u2014 and I said it \u2014 he had the voice \u2014 and this was what I was referring to \u2014 and I said, \u201cBoy, I\u2019d like to smash him.\u201d You know, I said that. I\u2019d like to punch him. This guy was unbelievably loud. He had a voice like Pavarotti. I said if I was his manager I would have made a lot of money for him, because he had the best voice. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. And he was a swinger. He was hitting people. He was punching and swinging and screaming \u2014 you couldn\u2019t make \u2014 so you have to stop. You know, there is also something about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, \u201cscrew everybody.\u201d And that\u2019s when I made that statement. He was absolutely out \u2014 I mean, he hit people and he screamed and then he was walking out and he\u2019s giving everybody the finger. And they don\u2019t talk about that. See, they don\u2019t talk about that. They say, \u201cDonald, wait a second, Donald, don\u2019t\u201d \u2014\nHIATT: But your answer is you condone violence when the guy is really egregious and terrible?\nTRUMP: No, I condone strong law and order. I\u2019ll tell you what they \u2014\nHIATT: Rip him out of his seat, punch him in the face, isn\u2019t that violent?\nTRUMP: Well he punched other people.\nHIATT: No, I understand that.\nTRUMP: Fred, he punched other people. He was punching people. He was \u2014 one guy was, you know, I\u2019d like to say \u2014\nJO-ANN ARMAO, ASSOCIATE EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: The Fayetteville protester who was sucker punched \u2014 he didn\u2019t punch anyone \u2014\nTRUMP: No.\nARMAO: He was being escorted from police, and he was sucker punched.\nTRUMP: No. When are you talking about? When?\nARMAO: In Fayetteville.\nCOREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER [to Trump]: North Carolina.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know which one.\nARMAO: Yes you do.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. Because we\u2019ve had so many \u2014\nARMAO: That\u2019s the gentleman you said you were going to look into to see whether or not to pay his legal fees.\nTRUMP: Oh well that\u2019s a different \u2014 that\u2019s different from the one I\u2019m talking about. This one was about a month ago. This one was before Fayetteville.\nARMAO: Well, okay, Fayetteville, do you condone violence in that case \u2014\nTRUMP: No I don\u2019t, no I don\u2019t, that\u2019s different \u2014\nARMAO: Where the protester is being walked out \u2014\nTRUMP: By the way, that\u2019s different \u2014\nARMAO: But, yet, you explained it that he was giving the finger and so he provoked it, so he got sucker punched. And you are going to possibly pay for his legal expenses.\nTRUMP: He did give the finger, and \u2014\nARMAO: So that\u2019s okay?\nTRUMP: Well, a lot of people don\u2019t \u2014 you know, the finger means, \u201cF you.\u201d A lot of people think \u2014 and you have children there, you have a lot of children that go, you know, they go with their parents \u2014 a lot of people think that\u2019s very inappropriate. I mean, you know \u2014\nARMAO: It\u2019s certainly inappropriate.\nTRUMP: Well, I think it is.\nARMAO: But does it \u2014 is it \u2014 does it qualify to \u2014\nTRUMP: So do you let him \u2014\nARMAO: \u2014 to punch him in the face?\nTRUMP: Again I don\u2019t condone it. So do you let him walk out, he\u2019s holding up his finger, telling everybody. Same thing happened, you know, the last one in \u2014\nHIATT: I guess the question is, when you then offer to pay the guy\u2019s legal fees, isn\u2019t that \u2014\nTRUMP: I didn\u2019t offer \u2014\nHIATT: Isn\u2019t that condoning?\nTRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t offer, Fred \u2014\nHIATT: You said you would consider it \u2014\nTRUMP: I said I want to look into it. I said I want to look into it. I didn\u2019t say that.\nHIATT: Isn\u2019t that condoning?\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t think so.\nHIATT: Doesn\u2019t that convey a message of approval?\nTRUMP: Don\u2019t think so.\nLEWANDOWSKI: To be fair, before every event, there is a public service announcement made about \u2014\nTRUMP: It\u2019s true.\nLEWANDOWSKI: \u2014 any potential protesters. That is made to everybody that says \u2014\nTRUMP: Strong.\nLEWANDOWSKI: \u2014 please do not engage these protesters. You know, they may cause a disturbance. Please do your best, let local law enforcement handle this or security at that venue. The problem becomes, with a massive crowd of twenty or thirty or forty thousand people, the resources that are there don\u2019t have the ability to get to all these people in a manner before the crowd reacts, because the agitators are inciting those people. So we are very clear at the onset, that there is a loud public notice that says, \u201cplease do not engage these people, please let them do their job, and let the local law enforcement deal with that.\u201d That\u2019s said at the very front end at every event.\nTRUMP: Very loud, and it\u2019s repeated over and over. Actually, I guess it\u2019s on tape, but they repeat it over and over. One thing that was interesting this weekend. We had in Phoenix, Arizona, we had an interesting incident. We had people, we had a major highway coming into the arena. It\u2019s not an arena, it\u2019s a huge open space, 60 acres, and it was packed. And we had a major highway coming in, and people \u2014 protesters \u2014 stopped their car in the middle of the highway, chained themselves to their cars, and the cars \u2014 blocked. They were there for a while. A car was not able to move. They were backed up for 20 \u2014 I mean, like, just forever. And, it was terrible. And they were very abusive, screaming, you know, \u201cscrew you, screw you, pigs, pigs\u201d \u2014 meaning to the cops. Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 now that was his territory. Okay, he\u2019s a tough cookie. Sheriff Joe saw this, he gave them a couple of minutes to move their car \u2014 they didn\u2019t move them \u2014 cut the chains, arrested the people and just moved the cars over. I don\u2019t know how they did it \u2014 just, they were gone in minutes after he came there. Minutes. It was amazing how quick. They actually had chains around their necks. They didn\u2019t even know why they were there. People \u2013 somebody was interviewed, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d They didn\u2019t even know.\nNobody ever talks about these people. They say, \u201cOh, Trump had a bad rally,\u201d or something. You know there are two sides to it, and honestly, there is really one side of it \u2013 because you see how bad this was. So what happened is they arrested three people. There were probably a hundred or a hundred-fifty protesters, there were 21,000 people there, there were 150 protesters that were creating havoc. As soon as the three people were arrested, everybody else ran. That was the last we heard, and I made a speech for, you know, a half hour, 45 minutes \u2013 not one person stood up and started screaming at this speech. It was sort of an amazing thing.\nNow Tucson was different. Different police force, different level of, you know, whatever, and we had numerous interruptions during the speech. You know, I\u2019ll be speaking, I\u2019ll be ready to make a point, and a guy will stand up and start, just screaming. Out of \u2014 from nowhere, for, like, no reason. Not even screaming things that make sense, and often screaming tremendous obscenities.\nI know [Lewandowski] went in \u2013 he took a lot of heat a couple of days ago in that same rally because he went in to get \u2013 to quiet people down, and they had a couple of signs \u201cF-you\u201d \u2013 it just said \u201cF-you,\u201d meaning the word spelled out, and you have cameras there, you know, it\u2019s on live television, and you have guys holding signs saying \u201cF-you Trump\u201d or just \u201cF-you,\u201d and they had numerous of those \u2013 there were, you know, probably ten of those signs throughout the arena.\nAnd he went in to say, please would you move the sign, and the woman in front \u2013 and I saw it \u2013 this guy grabbed the woman in front, okay, he [Lewandowski] hardly touched him \u2013 he took him \u2013 If he touched him at all it was just grabbing the shirt a little bit. But the guy was a real wiseguy. And he was screaming obscenities. He did grab the woman in front and ultimately he was led out by the security guy, who was right behind him.\nBut the reason is that the police were slow to get there. And the point is this: You\u2019re making a speech and you have guys getting up saying, [ Editor\u2019s note: Trump says the next few words in a hushed voice ] \u201cfuck you,\u201d and the whole place goes, \u201cWhoa,\u201d and it incites the place. They incite the place, because then everyone goes, \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d That\u2019s why they\u2019re all screaming \u201cUSA, USA,\u201d or \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump.\u201d\nYou can have 20,000 people and you can have like two people. Usually \u2013 it\u2019s amazing \u2013 usually it\u2019s one person. I mean, it\u2019s like they stage it. It\u2019s very professional. They have like one person here, one person here, one person.\nOkay, we\u2019re talking about the media. So, I\u2019ve never seen the media cover it from that angle. It\u2019s always, \u201cTrump had a\u201d \u2014 and here\u2019s the big thing, I mean, honestly, essentially nobody has heard\nHIATT: But just \u2013 given the Supreme Court rulings on libel \u2014 Sullivan v. New York Times \u2014 how would you change the law?\nTRUMP: I would just loosen them up.\nRUTH MARCUS: What does that mean?\n[Crosstalk]\nTRUMP: I\u2019d have to get my lawyers in to tell you, but I would loosen them up. I would loosen them up. If The Washington Post writes badly about me \u2013 and they do, they don\u2019t write good \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t think I get \u2013 I read some of the stories coming up here, and I said to my staff, I said, \u201cWhy are we even wasting our time? The hatred is so enormous.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. I mean, I do a good job. I have thousands of employees. I work hard.\nI\u2019m not looking for bad for our country. I\u2019m a very rational person, I\u2019m a very sane person. I\u2019m not looking for bad. But I read articles by you, and others. And, you know, we\u2019ve never \u2013 we don\u2019t know each other, and the level of hatred is so incredible, I actually said, \u201cWhy am I \u2013 why am I doing this? Why am I even here?\u201d And I don\u2019t expect anything to happen\u2013\nRYAN: Would that be the standard then? If there is an article that you feel has hatred, or is bad, would that be the basis for libel?\nTRUMP: No, if it\u2019s wrong. If it\u2019s wrong.\nRYAN: Wrong whether there\u2019s malice or not?\nTRUMP: I mean, The Washington Post never calls me. I never had a call, \u201cWhy \u2013 why did you do this?\u201d or \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d It\u2019s just, you know, like I\u2019m this horrible human being. And I\u2019m not. You know, the one thing we have in common I think we all love the country. Now, maybe we come at it from different sides, but nobody ever calls me. I mean, Bob Costa calls about a political story \u2013 he called because we\u2019re meeting senators in a little while and congressmen, supporters \u2013 but nobody ever calls.\nRYAN: The reason I keep asking this is because you\u2019ve said three times you\u2019ve said we are going to open up the libel laws and when you ask you what you mean you say hatred, or bad\u2013\nTRUMP: I want to make it more fair from the side where I am, because things are said that are libelous, things are said about me that are so egregious and so wrong, and right now according to the libel laws I can do almost nothing about it because I\u2019m a well-known person you know, etc., etc.\nJACKSON DIEHL, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Back to foreign policy a little bit, can you talk a little bit about what you see as the future of NATO? Should it expand in any way?\nTRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have \u2013 I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they\u2019re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with \u2014 why are we always the one that\u2019s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I\u2019ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions\u2013 hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are.\nDIEHL: Hundreds of billions?\nTRUMP: Billions. Well if you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea \u2014 I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal. When you look at the kind of money that our country is losing, we can\u2019t afford to do this. Certainly we can\u2019t afford to do it anymore.\nDIEHL: About Ukraine, was it right for the United States to impose sanctions on Russia when they invaded Crimea and would you keep those sanctions on them?\nTRUMP: I think the answer is yes, it was, but I don\u2019t see other people doing much about it. I see us doing things about it, but I don\u2019t see other people doing much about it.\nDIEHL: And could I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30,000 troops and\u2014\nTRUMP: No I didn\u2019t, oh no no no, okay, I know what you\u2019re saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that 20- to 30,000. They said, would you send troops? I didn\u2019t say send 20,000. I said, well the generals are saying you\u2019d need because they , what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need 20- to 30,000 troops, but I didn\u2019t say that I would send them.\nDIEHL: If they said that, would you go along with that and send the troops?\nTRUMP: I find it hard to go along with\u2014I mention that as an example because it\u2019s so much. That\u2019s why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said did I say that and I said that that\u2019s a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and I\u2019d give them tremendous air supporters and support , because we have to get rid of ISIS, okay, just so \u2014 we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved.\nDIEHL: What about China and the South China Sea. What do you think they\u2019re up to and\u2014\nTRUMP: I think it\u2019s a terrible situation, I think it\u2019s terrible they have no respect for\u2013\nDIEHL: \u2013and what should we do about it?\nTRUMP: Well look, we have power over China and people don\u2019t realize it. We have trade power over China. I don\u2019t think we are going to start World War III over what they did, it affects other countries certainly a lot more than it affects us. But\u2014and honestly, you know part of\u2014I always say we have to be unpredictable. We\u2019re totally predictable. And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. I hate when they say \u2014 like I said get rid of the oil, keep the oil, different things over the years, when people are saying what would you do with regard to the Middle East, when we left \u2014 We should have never been in Iraq. It was a horr- it was one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. We then got out badly, then after we got out, I said, \u201cKeep the oil. If we don\u2019t keep it Iran\u2019s going to get it.\u201d And it turns out Iran and ISIS basically\u2014\nHIATT: How do you keep it without troops, how do you defend the oil?\nTRUMP: You would\u2026 You would, well for that\u2013 for that, I would circle it. I would defend those areas.\nHIATT: With U.S. troops?\nTRUMP: Yeah, I would defend the areas with the oil. And I would have taken out a lot of oil. And, uh, I would have kept it. I mean, I would have kept it, because, look: Iran has the oil, and they\u2019re going to have the oil, well, the stuff they don\u2019t have, because Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as you\u2019re sitting there. And I\u2019ve been very good on this stuff. My prognostications, my predictions have become, have been very accurate, if you look.\nHIATT: So what do you think China\u2019s aims are in the South China Sea?\nTRUMP: Well I know China very well, because I deal with China all the time. I\u2019ve done very well. China\u2019s unbelievably ambitious. China is, uh\u2026 I mean, when I deal with China, you know, I have the Bank of America building, I\u2019ve done some great deals with China. I do deals with them all the time on, you know, selling apartments, and, you know, people say \u2018oh that\u2019s not the same thing.\u2019 The level of\u2026 uh, the largest bank in the world, 400 million customers, is a tenant of mine in New York, in Manhattan. The biggest bank in China. The biggest bank in the world.\nChina has got unbelievable ambitions. China feels very invincible. We have rebuilt China. They have drained so much money out of our country that they\u2019ve rebuilt China. Without us, you wouldn\u2019t see the airports and the roadways and the bridges; I mean, the George Washington Bridge is like, that\u2019s like a trinket compared to the bridges that they\u2019ve built in China. We don\u2019t build anymore, and it, you know, we had our day. But China, if you look at what\u2019s going on in China, you know, they go down to seven percent or eight percent and it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. Our GDP is right now zero. Essentially zero.\nDIEHL: Could you use trade to cause them to retreat in the South China Sea?\nTRUMP: I think so, yeah. I think so\nDIEHL: What would you do?\nTRUMP: We, well, you start making it tougher. They\u2019re selling their products to us for\u2026 you know, with no tax, no nothing. By the way, we can\u2019t deal with them, but they can deal with us. See, we are free trade. The story is, and I have so many people that deal with China \u2013they can easily sell their product here. No tax, no nothing, just \u2018come on, bring it all in, you know, bring in your apples, bring in everything you make\u2019 and no taxes whatsoever, right? If you want to deal with China, it\u2019s just the opposite. You can\u2019t do that. In other words, if you want to, if you\u2019re a manufacturer, you want to go into China? It\u2019s very hard to get your product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax.\nHIATT: So, if they occupied what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, is that something the United States\u2026\nTRUMP: Well, I, you know, again, I don\u2019t like to tell you what I\u2019d do, because I don\u2019t want to\u2026 You understand what I\u2019m saying, Fred? If I\u2026 Okay, if I say \u2018Well, we should go in and do this or that or that,\u2019 I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to sort of\u2026 red flag all over it. I do think this: It\u2019s an unbelievable thing that they\u2019ve done, it\u2019s unbelievable aggression, it\u2019s unbelievable lack of respect for this country.\nHIATT: This theory of unpredictability, I want to push a little bit, I mean \u2013 there are many people who think that North Korea invaded South Korea precisely because Acheson wasn\u2019t clear that we would defend South Korea. So I\u2019m curious, does ambiguity sometimes have dangers?\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019ll give you, I\u2019ll give you an example. President Obama, when he left Iraq, gave a specific date \u2013 we\u2019re going to be out. I thought that was a terrible thing to do. And the enemy pulled back, because they don\u2019t want die. Despite what you read, you know, they don\u2019t want to die \u2014 and they just pulled back, and after we left, all hell broke out, right? And I\u2019ll give you another example that I think was terrible: when they sent, a few months ago, they sent fifty troops in. You know, fifty elite troops. Now, why do we have to have a news conference to announce that we\u2019re sending fifty troops? So those troops now have targets on their back. And\u2026you shouldn\u2019t do it. We\u2019re so predictable: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019re sending fifty troops into Iraq or Syria. And these are our elite troops. And they\u2019re going to do this and that and that and this.\u201d And those troops now are being hunted. If you didn\u2019t send them, they wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if you didn\u2019t say that, they wouldn\u2019t know. I mean, there are times when you just can\u2019t be\u2026 You talk too much. We talk too much. I guess they thought that was good politically, to say we\u2019re sending fifty troops? I don\u2019t think it was good.\nLANE: Can I ask you\u2026Just going back to NATO, because\u2026\nTRUMP: Yes.\nLANE: As you know, the whole theory of NATO from the beginning was to keep the United States involved in the long term in Europe to balance, to promote a balance of power in that region so we wouldn\u2019t have a repeat of World War I and World War 2. And it seems to be like what you\u2019re saying is very similar to what President Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg, in that we have allies that become free riders. So it seems like there\u2019s some convergence with the president there. What concerns me about both is that to some extent it was always thought to be in our interest that we, yes, we would take some of the burden on, yes, even if the net-net was not 100 percent, even steven, with the Germans. So I\u2019d like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries? Right, you\u2019ve painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense? Tell me more. Because it\u2019s not that you want to pull the U.S. out.\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We\u2019re not a rich country. We\u2019re borrowing, we\u2019re borrowing all of this money. We\u2019re borrowing money from China, which is a sort of an amazing situation. But things are a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we\u2019re protecting Europe but we\u2019re spending a lot of money. Number 1, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it. Obama has been stronger on the Ukraine than all the other countries put together, and those other countries right next door to the Ukraine. And I just say we have, I\u2019m not even knocking it, I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, we\u2019re not treated fair. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re treated fair, Charles, anywhere. If you look everything we have. You know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet we\u2019re not reimbursed fairly for what we do. We\u2019re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. We\u2019re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.\nLANE: You know, well, they say and I think this is on public record, it\u2019s basically 50 percent of the non-personnel cost is paid by South Korea and Japan.\nTRUMP: 50 percent?\nLANE: Yeah.\nTRUMP: Why isn\u2019t it 100 percent?\nHIATT: Well I guess the question is, does the United States gain anything by having bases?\nTRUMP: Personally I don\u2019t think so. I personally don\u2019t think so. Look. I have great relationships with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But that\u2019s a wealthy country. They make the ships, they make the televisions, they make the air conditioning. They make tremendous amounts of products. It\u2019s a huge, it\u2019s a massive industrial complex country. And \u2014\nHIATT: So you don\u2019t think the US gains from being the force that sort of that helps keep the peace in the Pacific?\nTRUMP: I think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we\u2019re a poor country now. We\u2019re a debtor nation. How you going to get rid \u2013 let me ask you \u2013 how are you going get rid of $21 trillion in debt? You\u2019re going to be at 21 trillion in a matter of minutes because of that new omnibus budget. So they passed that ridiculous omnibus budget. How you going to get rid of that debt. We\u2019re spending that to protect other countries. We\u2019re not spending it on ourselves. Because we have, we have armor-plated vehicles that are obsolete. The best ones are given to the enemy. We give them to our allies over in the Middle East. A bullet shot in the air and they immediately run and the enemy takes over. I have a friend whose son is in his third, his third tour over in Iraq. He\u2019s over in, I mean he\u2019s a very special kid, he\u2019s a great kid. But he\u2019s over in the Middle East, and, uh, Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East, actually. And he said to me, I said to him what do you think. And he said, it\u2019s so sad. He said the enemy has our equipment \u2013 the new version \u2014 and we have all the old version, and the enemy has our equipment, because they get into a fight with the so-called people like the Freedom Fighters, you know the whole Syrian deal, where we\u2019re sending billions and billions of dollars worth, and they capture the equipment. In most cases the shots are fired and everybody leaves. And these are the people we\u2019re backing. And we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be another Saddam Hussein deal, in other words, let\u2019s get rid of Assad with these people and these people end up being worse. Okay? But he said, they have better equipment. It\u2019s our equipment. They have, I guess we send 2,300 Humvees over, all armor-plated. So we have wounded warriors, with no legs, with no arms, because they were driving in stuff without the armor. And the enemy has most of the new ones we sent over that they captured. And he said, it\u2019s so discouraging when they see that the enemy has better equipment than we have \u2013 and it\u2019s our equipment.\nHIATT: I\u2019d like to come back to the campaign. You said a few weeks ago after a family in Chicago gave some money to a PAC opposing you, you said, \u201cThey better watch out. They have a lot to hide.\u201d What should they watch out for?\nTRUMP: Look, they are spending vicious \u2026 I don\u2019t even know these people. Those Ricketts. I actually said they ought to focus on the Chicago Cubs and, you know, stop playing around. They spent millions of dollars fighting me in Florida. And out of 68 counties, I won 66. I won by 20 points, almost 20 points. Against, everybody thought he was a popular sitting senator. I had $38 million dollars spent on me in Florida over a short period of time. $38 million. And, you know, the Ricketts, I don\u2019t even know these people.\nHIATT: So, what does it mean, \u201cThey better watch out\u201d?\nTRUMP: Well, it means that I\u2019ll start spending on them. I\u2019ll start taking ads telling them all what a rotten job they\u2019re doing with the Chicago Cubs. I mean, they are spending on me. I mean, so am I allowed to say that? I\u2019ll start doing ads about their baseball team. That it\u2019s not properly run or that they haven\u2019t done a good job in the brokerage business lately.\nRYAN: Would you do that while you are president?\nTRUMP: No, not while I am president. No, not while I\u2019m president. That is two phases. Right now, look, you know, I went to a great school, I was a good student and all. I am an intelligent person. My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at MIT for 35 years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else. Dr. John Trump, a great guy. I\u2019m an intelligent person. I understand what is going on. Right now, I had 17 people who started out. They are almost all gone. If I were going to do that in a different fashion I think I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. You would be interviewing somebody else. But it is hard to act presidential when you are being \u2026 I mean, actually I think it is presidential because it is winning. And winning is a pretty good thing for this country because we don\u2019t win any more. And I say it all the time. We do not win any more. This country doesn\u2019t win. We don\u2019t win with trade. We don\u2019t win with \u2026 We can\u2019t even beat ISIS. And by the way, just to answer the rest of that question, I would knock the hell out of ISIS in some form. I would rather not do it with our troops, you understand that. Very important. Because I think saying that is very important because I was against the war in Iraq, although they found a clip talking to Howard Stern, I said, \u201cWell\u2026\u201d It was very unenthusiastic. Before they want in, I was totally against the war. I was against it for years. I actually had a delegation sent from the White House to talk to me because I guess I get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I was just against the war. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it did. But we have to knock out ISIS. We are living like in medieval times. Who ever heard of the heads chopped off?\nHIATT: Just back to the campaign. You are smart and you went to a good school. Yet you are up there and talking about your hands and the size of private \u2026\nTRUMP: No \u2026\nHIATT: \u2026 your private parts.\nTRUMP: No, no. No, no. I am not doing that.\nHIATT: Do you regret having engaged in that?\nTRUMP: No, I had to do it. Look, this guy. Here\u2019s my hands. Now I have my hands, I hear, on the New Yorker, a picture of my hands.\nMARCUS: You\u2019re on the cover.\nTRUMP: A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They\u2019re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, \u201cOh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means.\u201d This was not me. This was Rubio that said, \u201cHe has small hands and you know what that means.\u201d Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later \u2026 and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, \u201cMr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands.\u201d And then another one would say, \u201cYou have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cI thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands.\u201d I had fifty people \u2026 Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, \u201cHow are Mr. Trump\u2019s hands?\u201d My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, \u201cOh, your hands are very nice. They are normal.\u201d So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say \u2026 now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn\u2019t work out. Obviously, it didn\u2019t work too well. But one of the things he said was \u201cHe has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else.\u201d You can look it up. I didn\u2019t say it.\nMARCUS: You chose to raise it \u2026\nTRUMP: No, I chose to respond.\nMARUS: You chose to respond.\nTRUMP: I had no choice.\nMARCUS: You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I\u2019m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me \u2026 every time I\u2019d shake people\u2019s hand, \u201cOh, you have nice hands.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions \u2026 I even held up my hands, and said, \u201cLook, take a look at that hand.\u201d\nMARCUS: You told us in the debate \u2026.\nTRUMP: And by saying that, I solved the problem. Nobody questions. Everyone held my hand. I said look. Take a look at that hand.\nMARCUS: You told us in the debate that you guaranteed there was not another problem. Was that presidential? And why did you decide to do that?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, \u2018Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the\u2013 a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can\u2019t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I\u2019ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think it\u2019s not a question of presidential \u2026\nMARCUS: He said he regrets \u2026\nHIATT: Okay, let\u2019s move on here. Let\u2019s move on.\nTRUMP: I did feel I should respond. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But I felt I should respond because everybody was talking about it.\nRYAN: You [MUFFLED] mentioned a few minutes earlier here that you would knock ISIS. You\u2019ve mentioned it many times. You\u2019ve also mentioned the risk of putting American troop in a danger area. If you could substantially reduce the risk of harm to ground troops, would you use a battlefield nuclear weapon to take out ISIS?\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want to use, I don\u2019t want to start the process of nuclear. Remember the one thing that everybody has said, I\u2019m a counterpuncher. Rubio hit me. Bush hit me. When I said low energy, he\u2019s a low-energy individual, he hit me first. I spent, by the way he spent 18 million dollars\u2019 worth of negative ads on me. That\u2019s putting [MUFFLED]\u2026\nRYAN: This is about ISIS. You would not use a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS?\n[CROSSTALK]\nTRUMP: I\u2019ll tell you one thing, this is a very good looking group of people here. Could I just go around so I know who the hell I\u2019m talking to?\nHIATT: Sure, then I\u2019d like to let a couple of them get in questions.\nLEWANDOWSKI: We have got five minutes, hard out.\nHIATT: Okay.\nTRUMP: Oh is it?\nCORY: Yeah. You have a meeting you have to get to.\nTRUMP: Okay we do.\nARMAO: I\u2019m Jo-Ann Armao. I cover D.C. events. I want to ask you a question about what you think about D.C. voting rights or statehood.\nTRUMP: Okay. I\u2019ll talk about that.\nTOM TOLES, EDITORIAL CARTOONIST: Tom Toles.\nTRUMP: Hi, Tom.\nLANE: I\u2019m Charles \u2026\nTRUMP: Yes, I know Charles.\nSTROMBERG: Steve Stromberg, editorial writer.\nTRUMP: Right.\nMARCUS: Ruth Marcus.\nTRUMP: Right.\nRYAN: Fred Ryan.\nTRUMP: Right, right.\nDIEHL: Jackson Diehl.\nTRUMP: Good.\nJAMES DOWNIE: James Downie, digital opinions editor.\nTRUMP: Hi, James.\nMICHAEL LARABEE: Mike Larabee, I\u2019m the op-ed editor.\nTRUMP: Yes.\nCHRISTINE EMBA: Christine Emba.\nTRUMP: Hi, Christine.\nJAMIE RILEY: Jamie Riley, letters and local opinions.\nTRUMP: Good, yes, yes.\nKAREN ATTIAH: Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor.\nHIATT: Karen, you want to get a question in?\nATTIAH: Uh, yeah, I mean speaking again of the system of what a lot of people would say are some of the uglier components of your campaign; a lot of people have said you\u2019ve been running a very divisive campaign as far as racial divides, you\u2019ve noted you know your comments about Muslims, about Mexicans, immigrants and such. You have information that the country is becoming browner, is becoming younger, is becoming blacker. What in your vision of president, in your presidency, how would you bridge these divides and how will you address a\u2013 how are you going to run on a message of inclusion of all Americans?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, if you look at some polls that have come out, I\u2019m doing very well with African Americans. I\u2019m doing, actually if you look at the polls, a lot of the polls that came out, in the, um, what do they call it? Exit polls, like from Nevada and other places, I\u2019m doing very well with Hispanics.\nATTIAH: I think some of the polls are saying you\u2019re doing [in the] negatives.\nTRUMP: We do, if it\u2019s illegals, in other words, if it\u2019s everybody, but people that are legally living here, I\u2019m doing very well. In other words, people that are here, like Hispanics that are in the country, I\u2019m doing very well. People that vote. Like people leaving voting booths and all, I\u2019m doing very well with them. I want to be inclusive, but at the same time, people should come here legally. They should be here legally. And I think the reason I\u2019m doing, that I will do well, especially once I get started, don\u2019t forget I haven\u2019t even focused on Hillary yet. And, and as you know, you know I\u2019ve had polls that are against me, but I\u2019ve had many polls that say I\u2019d beat Hillary, but they\u2019re not that, that, they don\u2019t mean anything now because it\u2019s too early. Because I haven\u2019t hit her. I\u2019ve only hit her once, and that was eight weeks ago, but, I haven\u2019t started on Hillary yet, and when I do I think I\u2019ll be able to make my points. I mean, you know, but, but I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you.\nATTIAH: But do you feel that your messages, your rhetoric, are dangerous and divisive for this country? How do you feel they\u2019re \u2026.\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t think so. No, I don\u2019t think so. With the Muslim thing I think it\u2019s a serious problem. I\u2019ve had Muslims call and tell me you\u2019re right with the Muslim thing, I think it\u2019s a serious problem. And it\u2019s a problem that has to be addressed. I mean, there\u2019s tremendous hatred. Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, and he\u2019s living right next to where he grew up. There\u2019s a serious, serious problem with the Muslims and it\u2019s got to be addressed. It\u2019s temporary, and it\u2019s got to be addressed. And you know you may think of it as negative. Many people think it\u2019s very positive.\nHIATT: How would you identify people to keep them out of this country?\nTRUMP: Well look, there\u2019s many exceptions. There\u2019s many \u2013 everything, you\u2019re going to go through a process. But we have to be very careful. And I was really referring in particular, you know, to migrations \u2013 Syrians, the whole migration, where we\u2019re going to take in thousands. And I heard in the Democrat debate, I heard 55,000, okay. 55,000. Now they say it\u2019s really ten [thousand], but it\u2019s already 10, and I just don\u2019t think we can take people into this country. You saw what two people did \u2013 the woman and the man, whether she radicalized him or [inaudible] \u2013 but you saw what two people did, and I just don\u2019t think we can take people in when we have no idea who they are, where they come from. There\u2019s no documents, there\u2019s no paper, and we have ISIS looming over our head, and we have tremendous destruction. We lost the World Trade Center, we lost the Pentag \u2013 you know, we had a plane go into the Pentagon, etc.\nARMAO: D.C.: You told Chuck Todd last year on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that you love D.C., you love the people, that you want to do what\u2019s best for them. They think what\u2019s best for them is statehood or at the very least voting rights. What is your position on those two things?\nTRUMP: I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C. I think it\u2019s a tough thing. I don\u2019t have a position on it yet. I would form a position. But I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C.\nARMAO: Tough politically?\nTRUMP: I think it\u2019s just something that I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be inclined to do. I\u2019d like to study it. It\u2019s not a question really \u2013 maybe Chuck didn\u2019t ask me like you\u2019re asking me \u2013 I don\u2019t see statehood for D.C.\nARMAO: What about having a vote in the House of Representatives?\nTRUMP: I think that\u2019s something that would be okay. Having representation would be okay.\nHIATT: Last one: You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change?\nTRUMP: I think there\u2019s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. I\u2019m not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes \u2013 if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they don\u2019t know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now they\u2019re using \u201cextreme weather\u201d I guess more than any other phrase. I am not \u2013 I know it hurts me with this room, and I know it\u2019s probably a killer with this room \u2013 but I am not a believer. Perhaps there\u2019s a minor effect, but I\u2019m not a big believer in man-made climate change.\nSTROMBERG: Don\u2019t good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them?\nTRUMP: Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think we\u2019re in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me \u2013 I know President Obama thought it was climate change \u2013 to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. That\u2019s \u2013 that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we don\u2019t even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We don\u2019t know who has them. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons.\nRYAN: Thank you for joining us.",

      "text": "For AIPAC , it is crucial to appeal across the political spectrum. But Israel has become an increasingly divisive issue with the public. Credit Illustration by Matt Dorfman On July 23rd, officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2014the powerful lobbying group known as AIPAC\u2014gathered in a conference room at the Capitol for a closed meeting with a dozen Democratic senators. The agenda of the meeting, which was attended by other Jewish leaders as well, was the war in the Gaza Strip. In the century-long conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the previous two weeks had been particularly harrowing. In Israeli towns and cities, families heard sirens warning of incoming rockets and raced to shelters. In Gaza, there were scenes of utter devastation, with hundreds of Palestinian children dead from bombing and mortar fire. The Israeli government claimed that it had taken extraordinary measures to minimize civilian casualties, but the United Nations was launching an inquiry into possible war crimes. Even before the fighting escalated, the United States, Israel\u2019s closest ally, had made little secret of its frustration with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cHow will it have peace if it is unwilling to delineate a border, end the occupation, and allow for Palestinian sovereignty, security, and dignity?\u201d Philip Gordon, the White House co\u00f6rdinator for the Middle East, said in early July. \u201cIt cannot maintain military control of another people indefinitely. Doing so is not only wrong but a recipe for resentment and recurring instability.\u201d Although the Administration repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Israel, it was clearly uncomfortable with the scale of Israel\u2019s aggression. AIPAC did not share this unease; it endorsed a Senate resolution in support of Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend its citizens,\u201d which had seventy-nine co-sponsors and passed without a word of dissent. AIPAC is prideful about its influence. Its promotional literature points out that a reception during its annual policy conference, in Washington, \u201cwill be attended by more members of Congress than almost any other event, except for a joint session of Congress or a State of the Union address.\u201d A former AIPAC executive, Steven Rosen, was fond of telling people that he could take out a napkin at any Senate hangout and get signatures of support for one issue or another from scores of senators. AIPAC has more than a hundred thousand members, a network of seventeen regional offices, and a vast pool of donors. The lobby does not raise funds directly. Its members do, and the amount of money they channel to political candidates is difficult to track. But everybody in Congress recognizes its influence in elections, and the effect is evident. In 2011, when the Palestinians announced that they would petition the U.N. for statehood, AIPAC helped persuade four hundred and forty-six members of Congress to co-sponsor resolutions opposing the idea. During the Gaza conflict, AIPAC has made a priority of sending a message of bipartisan congressional support for all of Israel\u2019s actions. Pro-Israel resolutions passed by unanimous consent carry weight, but not nearly so much as military funding. During the fighting, Israel has relied on the Iron Dome system, a U.S.-funded missile defense that has largely neutralized Hamas\u2019s rockets. Although the U.S. was scheduled to deliver $351 million for the system starting in October, AIPAC wanted more money right away. On July 22nd, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had sent a letter to Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, seeking an immediate payment of $225 million. In the conference room, the senators sat on one side of a long table, the Jewish leaders on the other. Robert Cohen, the president of AIPAC, justified Israel\u2019s assault, agreeing with Netanyahu that Hamas was ultimately responsible for the deaths of its own citizens. At one point, Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, asked about conservative trends in Israel, a participant recalled. \u201cHe said that he supports Israel, but he\u2019s concerned that Israel is headed toward a one-state solution\u2014and that would be so damaging and dangerous for everyone involved.\u201d Charles Schumer, the senior Democrat from New York, interrupted. Turning to address the room, he said, \u201cIt troubles me when I hear people equate Israel and Hamas. That\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s terrible!\u201d Kaine protested, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Cohen simply repeated that Hamas was to blame for everything that was happening. The Senate, preparing for its August recess, hastened to vote on the Iron Dome funding. At first, the appropriation was bundled into an emergency bill that also included money to address the underage refugees flooding across the Mexican border. But, with only a few days left before the break began, that bill got mired in a partisan fight. Reid tried to package Iron Dome with money for fighting wildfires, and then offered it by itself; both efforts failed, stopped largely by budget hawks. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get it done the night before recess, you bemoan the fact that you couldn\u2019t get it done, and everybody goes home,\u201d a congressional staffer said. Instead, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, the Republican leader, decided to stay over, even if it meant missing an event at home. The next morning, with the halls of the Senate all but empty, an unusual session was convened so that McConnell and Reid could try again to pass the bill; Tim Kaine was also there, along with the Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham. \u201cThere were five senators present and literally no one else!\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThey reintroduced it and passed it. This was one of the more amazing feats, for AIPAC.\u201d In a press conference, Graham, who has been a major recipient of campaign contributions connected to AIPAC, pointed out that the funding for Iron Dome was intended as a gesture of solidarity with Israel. \u201cNot only are we going to give you more missiles\u2014we\u2019re going to be a better friend,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for you in the international court of public opinion. We\u2019re going to fight for you in the United Nations.\u201d The influence of AIPAC, like that of the lobbies for firearms, banking, defense, and energy interests, has long been a feature of politics in Washington, particularly on Capitol Hill. But that influence, like the community that AIPAC intends to represent, is not static. For decades, AIPAC has thrived on bipartisanship, exerting its influence on congressional Democrats and Republicans alike. But Israel\u2019s government, now dominated by a coalition of right-wing parties led by Likud, has made compromise far less likely than it was a generation ago. Prime Minister Netanyahu, the leader of Likud and an unabashed partisan of the Republican view of the world, took office at about the same time as President Obama, and the two have clashed frequently over the expansion of Israeli settlements and the contours of a potential peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Although both men repeatedly speak of the unshakable bond between the U.S. and Israel, their relationship has been fraught from the start. In 2012, Netanyahu made little secret of the fact that he hoped Mitt Romney would win the election. Time and again\u2014over issues ranging from Iran to the Palestinians\u2014AIPAC has sided strongly with Netanyahu against Obama. Buy a cartoon AIPAC\u2019s spokesman, Marshall Wittmann, said that the lobby had no loyalty to any political party, in Israel or in the U.S., and that to suggest otherwise was a \u201cmalicious mischaracterization.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cwe are a bipartisan organization of Americans who exercise our constitutional right to lobby the government.\u201d For AIPAC, whose stated mission is to improve relations between the U.S. and Israel, it is crucial to appeal across the political spectrum. In recent years, though, Israel has become an increasingly divisive issue among the American public. Support for Israel among Republicans is at seventy-three per cent, and at forty-four per cent among Democrats, according to a poll conducted in July by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press; the divide is even greater between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. This difference represents a schism among American Jews\u2014AIPAC\u2019s vital core. For decades, the Jewish community was generally united in its support for Israel. Today, a growing number of American Jews, though still devoted to Israel, struggle with the lack of progress toward peace with the Palestinians. Many feel that AIPAC does not speak for them. The Pew Center\u2019s survey found that only thirty-eight per cent of American Jews believe that the Israeli government is sincerely pursuing peace; forty-four per cent believe that the construction of new settlements damages Israel\u2019s national security. In a Gallup poll in late July, only a quarter of Americans under the age of thirty thought that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were justified. As Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the executive director of the left-leaning T\u2019ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, told me, \u201cMany people I know in their twenties and thirties say, I have a perfectly good Jewish life here\u2014why do I need to worry about this country in the Middle East where they\u2019re not representing who I am as a Jew? I\u2019m not proud of what\u2019s happening there. I\u2019m certainly not going to send money. \u201d This is precisely the kind of ambivalence that AIPAC adherents describe as destructive. And yet even Israeli politicians recognize that AIPAC faces a shifting landscape of opinion. Shimon Peres, who served as Prime Minister and, most recently, as President, says, \u201cMy impression is that AIPAC is weaker among the younger people. It has a solid majority of people of a certain age, but it\u2019s not the same among younger people.\u201d For AIPAC, the tension with the Obama Administration over Gaza comes amid a long series of conflicts. Perhaps the most significant of these is over the question of Iran\u2019s obtaining a nuclear weapon. Last October, Iran and the consortium of world powers known as P5+1\u2014Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United States\u2014met in Geneva to begin talks. For two decades, AIPAC has been warning that if Iran acquired nuclear arms it would pose an existential threat to Israel, which has had a nuclear capacity since the late sixties. Netanyahu has insisted that the United States\u2014or Israel alone, if necessary\u2014must be prepared to take military action against Iran. The Obama Administration, too, has said that a nuclear Iran is unthinkable and that \u201call options\u201d\u2014including military options\u2014\u201care on the table.\u201d But Netanyahu fears that Obama is prepared to settle for too little in the negotiations, and, when they began, he launched an uninhibited campaign of public diplomacy against them. In early November, after meeting in Jerusalem with Secretary of State John Kerry, he proclaimed a tentative proposal \u201ca very, very bad deal. It is the deal of the century for Iran.\u201d A photo op for the two men was abruptly cancelled, and Kerry returned to Switzerland. Later that month, Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., met with a bipartisan group of two dozen congressmen in the offices of John Boehner, the House Speaker. Dermer, who comes from a political family in Miami, worked in the nineties for the Republican consultant Frank Luntz as he shaped Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract with America campaign. A few years later, Dermer emigrated to Israel, where he worked as a political consultant and wrote columns for the Jerusalem Post, a conservative daily, in which he referred to Jews who denounced the occupation as \u201cself-haters.\u201d When Netanyahu took office in 2009, he brought in Dermer as a top adviser, and the two became virtually inseparable. \u201cWhenever we met with Bibi in the last several years, Dermer was there,\u201d a former congressional aide said. \u201cHe was like Bibi\u2019s Mini-Me.\u201d In Boehner\u2019s offices, a senior Democrat recalled, \u201cDermer was very critical of the proposed Iran nuclear agreement. He talked about how Reagan would never have done anything like this.\u201d Finally, one of the other politicians in the room had to advise him, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about what Reagan would do. He\u2019s not very popular with Democrats.\u201d The great incentive that the P5+1 could offer Iran was to reduce the sanctions that have crippled its economy. As the talks proceeded, though, Israel\u2019s supporters in Congress were talking about legislation that would instead toughen the sanctions. Dermer didn\u2019t say specifically that he favored such a law\u2014representatives of foreign governments customarily do not advocate for specific U.S. legislation\u2014but it was clear that that was what he and the Israeli leadership wanted. A former congressional staff member who attended the meeting said, \u201cThe implicit critique was the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the President.\u201d Obama\u2019s aides were alarmed by the possibility that AIPAC might endorse new sanctions legislation. They invited Howard Kohr, the group\u2019s chief executive officer, and officials from other prominent Jewish organizations to briefings at the White House. Members of the Administration\u2019s negotiating team, together with State Department officials, walked them through the issues. \u201cWe said, \u2018We know you guys are going to take a tough line on these negotiations, but stay inside the tent and work with us,\u2019 \u201d a senior Administration official recalled. \u201cWe told them directly that a sanctions bill would blow up the negotiations\u2014the Iranians would walk away from the table. They said, \u2018This bill is to strengthen your hand in diplomacy.\u2019 We kept saying, \u2018It doesn\u2019t strengthen our hand in diplomacy. Why do you know better than we do what strengthens our hand? Nobody involved in the diplomacy thinks that. \u2019 \u201d In late November, the negotiators announced an interim Joint Plan of Action. For a period of six months, Iran and the six world powers would work toward a comprehensive solution; in the meantime, Iran would limit its nuclear energy program in exchange for initial relief from sanctions. Netanyahu blasted the agreement, calling it a \u201chistoric mistake,\u201d and, within a few days, the leadership of AIPAC committed itself to fighting for new sanctions. A senior Democrat close to AIPAC described to me the intimate interplay between Netanyahu\u2019s circle and the lobby. \u201cThere are people in AIPAC who believe that it should be an arm of the Likud, an arm of the Republican Party,\u201d he said. Wittmann, the lobby\u2019s spokesman, disputed this, saying, \u201cAIPAC does not take any orders or direction from any foreign principal, in Israel or elsewhere.\u201d For the Israeli leadership and many of its advocates, the Iran negotiations presented an especially vexing problem of political triangulation. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran\u2019s previous President, had been a kind of ideal adversary, attracting widespread outrage by questioning whether the Holocaust had taken place and by challenging Israel\u2019s right to exist. Danny Ayalon, a former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., once described Ahmadinejad\u2019s hateful rhetoric to me as \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving.\u201d But Iran\u2019s new President, Hassan Rouhani, was carefully presenting himself as a relative moderate. Netanyahu would have none of it, calling Rouhani \u201ca wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d \u201cI come from a hundred years in the future to warn you that nothing really changes in the next hundred years.\u201d Buy a cartoon AIPAC worked to mobilize its friends in Congress. Mark Kirk, a Republican senator from Illinois and a major beneficiary of AIPAC-related funding, began pressing to pass a new sanctions bill. \u201cHe was saying, \u2018We\u2019re in negotiations with a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing!\u2019 \u201d a former Senate aide recalled. The bill, co-sponsored by Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, was drafted with considerable input from AIPAC. This was the first time in decades that the lobby had challenged the sitting U.S. President so overtly. The Obama Administration was furious. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to disagree on some aspect of the peace process, on things that are tough for Israel to do,\u201d the senior Administration official told me. \u201cBut this is American foreign policy that they were seeking to essentially derail. There was no other logic to it than ending the negotiations, and the gravity of that was shocking.\u201d AIPAC was incorporated in 1963, fifteen years after the State of Israel came into being. Its leader, Isaiah (Si) Kenen, had been a lobbyist for American Zionist organizations and an employee of Israel\u2019s Office of Information at the United Nations. In that job, Kenen had been obligated to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which had stringent disclosure requirements about financial expenditures and communications with the U.S. government. The journalist M. J. Rosenberg, who volunteered at AIPAC in 1973 and is now a critic of it, recalled Kenen\u2019s saying that the foreign-agent model was too restrictive. AIPAC would lobby Congress for aid to Israel, but its members would be Americans, taking orders from an American board of directors. Rosenberg told me that Kenen was \u201can old-fashioned liberal\u201d who liked to say, \u201cAIPAC has no enemies, only friends and potential friends.\u201d When asked which politicians he hoped to elect, he said, \u201cWe play with the hand that is dealt us.\u201d Congress must lead, he said, and \u201cour job is to help it lead.\u201d Kenen retired in 1974, and by the late eighties AIPAC\u2019s board had come to be dominated by a group of wealthy Jewish businessmen known as the Gang of Four: Mayer (Bubba) Mitchell, Edward Levy, Jr., Robert Asher, and Larry Weinberg. Weinberg was a Democrat who gradually moved to the right. The others were Republicans. In 1980, AIPAC hired Thomas Dine, a former diplomat and congressional staffer, as its executive director. Dine set out to develop a nationwide network that would enable AIPAC to influence every member of Congress. This was a daunting challenge. Jews made up less than three per cent of the American population, concentrated in nine states, and they voted overwhelmingly Democratic. How could AIPAC, with such a small base, become a political force in both parties and in every state? Dine launched a grass-roots campaign, sending young staff members around the country to search for Jews in states where there were few. In Lubbock, Texas, for instance, they found nine who were willing to meet\u2014a tiny group who cared deeply about Israel but never thought that they could play a political role. The lobby created four hundred and thirty-five \u201ccongressional caucuses,\u201d groups of activists who would meet with their member of Congress to talk about the pro-Israel agenda. Dine decided that \u201cif you wanted to have influence you had to be a fund-raiser.\u201d Despite its name, AIPAC is not a political-action committee, and therefore cannot contribute to campaigns. But in the eighties, as campaign-finance laws changed and PACs proliferated, AIPAC helped form pro-Israel PACs. By the end of the decade, there were dozens. Most had generic-sounding names, like Heartland Political Action Committee, and they formed a loose constellation around AIPAC. Though there was no formal relationship, in many cases the leader was an AIPAC member, and as the PACs raised funds they looked to the broader organization for direction. Members\u2019 contributions were often bundled. \u201cAIPAC will select some dentist in Boise, say, to be the bundler,\u201d a former longtime AIPAC member said. \u201cThey tell people in New York and other cities to send their five-thousand-dollar checks to him. But AIPAC has to teach people discipline\u2014because all those people who are giving five thousand dollars would ordinarily want recognition. The purpose is to make the dentist into a big shot\u2014he\u2019s the one who has all this money to give to the congressman\u2019s campaign.\u201d AIPAC representatives tried to match each member of Congress with a contact who shared the congressman\u2019s interests. If a member of Congress rode a Harley-Davidson, AIPAC found a contact who did, too. The goal was to develop people who could get a member of Congress on the phone at a moment\u2019s notice. That persistence and persuasion paid off. Howard Berman, a former congressman from California, recalled that Bubba Mitchell became friends with Sonny Callahan, a fellow-resident of Mobile, Alabama, when Callahan ran for Congress in 1984. Eventually, Callahan became chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. \u201cSonny had always been against foreign aid,\u201d Berman said. \u201cThen he voted for it!\u201d Republicans knew that they would never get more than a minority of the Jewish electorate, but AIPAC members convinced them that voting the right way would lead to campaign contributions. It was a winning argument. In 1984, Mitch McConnell narrowly beat AIPAC supporters\u2019 preferred candidate, the incumbent Democrat Walter Huddleston. Afterward, McConnell met with two AIPAC officials and said to them, \u201cLet me be very clear. What do I need to do to make sure that the next time around I get the community support?\u201d AIPAC members let Republicans know that, if they supported AIPAC positions, the lobby would view them as \u201cfriendly incumbents,\u201d and would not abandon them for a Democratic challenger. The Connecticut Republican senator Lowell Weicker voted consistently with AIPAC; in 1988, he was challenged by the Democrat Joe Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew. Lieberman won, but Weicker got the majority of funding from Jewish donors. In the early days, Howard Berman said, \u201cAIPAC was knocking on an unlocked door.\u201d Most Americans have been favorably disposed toward Israel since its founding, and no other lobby spoke for them on a national scale. Unlike other lobbies\u2014such as the N.R.A., which is opposed by various anti-gun groups\u2014AIPAC did not face a significant and well-funded countervailing force. It also had the resources to finance an expensive and emotionally charged form of persuasion. Dine estimated that in the eighties and nineties contributions from AIPAC members often constituted roughly ten to fifteen per cent of a typical congressional campaign budget. AIPAC provided lavish trips to Israel for legislators and other opinion-makers. Nevertheless, the lobby did not endorse or rank candidates. \u201cWe made the decision to be one step removed,\u201d Dine said. \u201cOrrin Hatch once said, \u2018Dine, your genius is to play an invisible bass drum, and the Jews hear it when you play it.\u2019 \u201d In 1982, after an Illinois congressman named Paul Findley described himself as \u201cYasir Arafat\u2019s best friend in Congress,\u201d AIPAC members encouraged Dick Durbin, a political unknown, to run against him. Robert Asher, a Chicago businessman, sent out scores of letters to his friends, along with Durbin\u2019s position paper on Israel, asking them to send checks. Durbin won, and he is now the Senate Majority Whip. (Findley later wrote a book that made extravagant claims about the power of the Israel lobby.) In 1984, AIPAC affiliates decided that Senator Charles Percy, an Illinois Republican, was unfriendly to Israel. In the next election, Paul Simon, a liberal Democrat, won Percy\u2019s seat. Dine said at the time, \u201cJews in America, from coast to coast, gathered to oust Percy. And American politicians\u2014those who hold public positions now, and those who aspire\u2014got the message.\u201d \u201cFor a militia, he\u2019s not very well regulated.\u201d Buy a cartoon As AIPAC grew, its leaders began to conceive of their mission as something more than winning support and aid for Israel. The Gang of Four, a former AIPAC official noted, \u201ccreated an interesting mantra that they honestly believed: that, if AIPAC had existed prior to the Second World War, America would have stopped Hitler. It\u2019s a great motivator, and a great fund-raiser\u2014but I think it\u2019s also AIPAC\u2019s greatest weakness. Because if you convince yourself that, if only you had been around, six million Jews would not have been killed, then you sort of lose sight of the fact that the U.S. has its own foreign policy, and, while it is extremely friendly to Israel, it will only go so far.\u201d In the fall of 1991, President George H. W. Bush decided to delay ten billion dollars in loan guarantees to Israel, largely because of the continuing expansion of settlements. In response, AIPAC sent activists to Capitol Hill. The lobby was confident. Its officials had told Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli Prime Minister at the time, that Bush did not have the political desire to take on AIPAC, according to a memoir by former Secretary of State James Baker. But Bush proved willing to fight. The former AIPAC official recalled that Bubba Mitchell was summoned to the White House for a meeting: \u201cWhen he came back to the AIPAC boardroom, an hour after the meeting, he was still shaking\u2014because the President of the United States yelled at him!\u201d Soon afterward, Bush remarked that he was \u201cone lonely little guy\u201d fighting \u201csomething like a thousand lobbyists.\u201d The Senate lined up behind him, and voted to postpone consideration of the loan guarantees. For AIPAC, this marked the beginning of a difficult period. The next June, Israeli voters ousted Shamir and his Likud Party and voted in Labor, headed by Yitzhak Rabin. After a career of military campaigns and cautious politics, Rabin began a transformation, offering to scale back settlement activity. In response, Bush asked Congress to approve the loan guarantees. Afterward, Rabin admonished the leaders of AIPAC, telling them that they had done more harm than good by waging battles \u201cthat were lost in advance.\u201d Daniel Kurtzer, then the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told me, \u201cRabin was furious with AIPAC. He felt they were allied with Likud and would undermine him in what he was trying to do.\u201d In September, 1993, Rabin and Arafat signed the Oslo Accords, which were aimed at building a formal peace process with the Palestine Liberation Organization. AIPAC officially endorsed the agreement, and still does. But many members were uncomfortable with it, according to Keith Weissman, a former analyst for the lobby. \u201cAIPAC couldn\u2019t act like they were rejecting what the government of Israel did, but the outcry in the organization about Oslo was so great that they found ways to sabotage it,\u201d he said. (In 2005, Weissman was indicted, along with Steven Rosen, for conspiring to pass national-defense information to a reporter and an Israeli government agent, and AIPAC fired them. The charges were ultimately dropped.) As part of the agreement, the U.S. was to make funds available to the Palestinians, Weissman said. \u201cThe Israelis wanted the money to go to Arafat, for what they called \u2018walking-around money.\u2019 But AIPAC supported a bill in Congress to make sure that the money was never given directly to Arafat and his people, and to monitor closely what was done with it. And, because I knew Arabic, they had me following all of Arafat\u2019s speeches. Was he saying one thing here, and another thing there? Our department became P.L.O. compliance-watchers. The idea was to cripple Oslo.\u201d In 1995, AIPAC encouraged Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House, to support bipartisan legislation to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This put Rabin in a political corner. On one hand, he knew that such a move would infuriate the Arab world and endanger the Oslo process. On the other, as Yossi Beilin, then an official in the Labor government, pointed out, \u201cYou are the Prime Minister of Israel and you are telling American Jews, \u2018Don\u2019t ask for recognition of Jerusalem as our capital\u2019? Nobody can do that!\u201d At a dinner with AIPAC leaders, Rabin told them that he did not support the bill; they continued to promote it nonetheless. In October, the bill passed in Congress, by an overwhelming majority. President Bill Clinton invoked a national-security waiver to prevent its enactment, and so has every President since. In 1999, Ehud Barak, also of the Labor Party, became Prime Minister, and, as Rabin had, he grew friendly with Clinton. \u201cAIPAC flourishes when there is tension between Israel and the U.S., because then they have a role to play,\u201d Gadi Baltiansky, who was Barak\u2019s press spokesman, told me. \u201cBut the relations between Rabin and Clinton, and then Barak and Clinton, were so good that AIPAC was not needed. Barak gave them courtesy meetings. He just didn\u2019t see them as real players.\u201d Still, the lobby maintained its sway in Congress. In 2000, Barak sent Beilin, who was then the Justice Minister, to obtain money that Clinton had promised Israel but never released. Beilin went to see Sandy Berger, Clinton\u2019s national-security adviser. \u201cHe said this money is tied to two hundred and twenty-five million dollars in assistance to Egypt,\u201d Beilin recalled. \u201cWe cannot disburse the money to Israel unless we do to Egypt, so we need to convince Congress to support the whole package. I said, \u2018I am speaking on behalf of my Prime Minister. We want Egypt to get the money.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yossi, this is really wonderful. Do you know somebody in AIPAC?\u2019 \u201d Beilin was astonished: \u201cIt was kind of Kafka\u2014the U.S. national-security adviser is asking the Minister of Justice in Israel whether he knows somebody at AIPAC!\u201d He went to see Howard Kohr, the AIPAC C.E.O., a onetime employee of the Republican Jewish Coalition whom a former U.S. government official described to me as \u201ca comfortable Likudnik.\u201d Kohr told Beilin that it was impossible to allow Egypt to get the money. \u201cYou may think it was wrong for Israel to vote for Barak as Prime Minister\u2014fine,\u201d Beilin recalled saying. \u201cBut do you really believe that you represent Israel more than all of us?\u201d By the end of Barak\u2019s term, in 2001, the money had not been released, to Israel or to Egypt. \u201cThey always want to punish the Arabs,\u201d Beilin concluded. \u201cThey are a very rightist organization, which doesn\u2019t represent the majority of Jews in America, who are so Democratic and liberal. They want to protect Israel from itself\u2014especially when moderate people are Israel\u2019s leaders.\u201d In the spring of 2008, AIPAC moved from cramped quarters on Capitol Hill to a gleaming new seven-story building on H Street, downtown. At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Howard Kohr introduced Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate who had been a generous donor to AIPAC since the nineties, and who had helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel (paying only for Republican members). On this bright spring day, according to someone who was in the audience, Adelson recalled that Kohr had telephoned him, asking him to have lunch. Adelson remembered wondering, How much is this lunch going to cost me? Well, he went on, it cost him ten million dollars: the building was the result. He later told his wife that Kohr should have asked him for fifty million. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to join the Sea Level Club, either.\u201d Buy a cartoon Netanyahu became Prime Minister the following year. AIPAC officials had been close to him since the eighties, when he worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, and stuck with him when, in 1990, he was banned from the State Department for saying that U.S. policy was built \u201con a foundation of distortion and lies.\u201d As Prime Minister, Netanyahu had a difficult relationship with Bill Clinton, largely because Clinton found him unwilling to stop the expansion of settlements and to meaningfully advance the peace process\u2014a sharp contrast with the approach of Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995. Then as now, Netanyahu displayed a vivid sense of his own historical importance, as well as flashes of disdain for the American President. After their first meeting, Clinton sent a message to another Israeli, wryly complaining that he had emerged uncertain who, exactly, was the President of a superpower. But, even if Netanyahu had trouble with the executive branch, AIPAC could help deliver the support of Congress, and a friendly Congress could take away the President\u2019s strongest negotiating chit\u2014the multibillion-dollar packages of military aid that go to Israel each year. The same dynamic was repeated during Barack Obama\u2019s first term. Israeli conservatives were wary, sensing that Obama, in their terms, was a leftist, sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. They took note when, during the 2008 campaign, Obama said, \u201cI think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you\u2019re opposed to Israel, that you\u2019re anti-Israel, and that can\u2019t be the measure of our friendship with Israel.\u201d At Obama\u2019s first meeting with Netanyahu, in May, 2009, Dermer came along, and found himself unable to observe the well-established protocol that one does not interrupt the President. As Obama spoke, Dermer\u2019s hand shot up: \u201cExcuse me, Mr. President, I beg to differ!\u201d Obama demanded a full settlement freeze, as a means of convincing the Palestinians that Netanyahu was not merely stalling the Americans. Netanyahu was incensed, and AIPAC rallied members of Congress to protest. At an AIPAC conference, Dermer declared that Netanyahu would chart his own course with the Palestinians: \u201cThe days of continuing down the same path of weakness and capitulation and concessions, hoping\u2014hoping\u2014that somehow the Palestinians would respond in kind, are over.\u201d Applause swept the room. In a speech at Bar-Ilan University, in June, 2009, Netanyahu seemed to endorse a two-state solution, if in rather guarded terms. Leaders of the settler movement and even many of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud allies were furious at this seemingly historic shift for the Party, though, with time, many of them interpreted the speech as a tactical sop to the United States. No less significant, perhaps, Netanyahu introduced a condition that could make a final resolution impossible\u2014the demand that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state. \u201cIt was a stroke of political brilliance,\u201d the former Senate aide, who had worked closely with Dermer, told me. \u201cHe managed to take the two-state issue off the table and put it back on the Palestinians.\u201d In March, 2010, while Vice-President Joe Biden was visiting Israel, the Netanyahu government announced that it was building sixteen hundred new housing units for Jews in Ramat Shlomo, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Biden said that the move \u201cundermines the trust we need right now.\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Netanyahu to upbraid him. But, while Obama and his team viewed the move as a political insult and yet another blow to a potential two-state solution, AIPAC went into defensive mode, sending an e-mail to its members saying that the Administration\u2019s criticisms of Israel were \u201ca matter of serious concern.\u201d Soon afterward, a letter circulated in the House calling on the Obama Administration to \u201creinforce\u201d the relationship. Three hundred and twenty-seven House members signed it. A couple of months later, when the U.S. tried to extend a partial moratorium on construction in settlements in the West Bank, AIPAC fought against the extension. Obama eventually yielded. In May, 2011, Obama gave a speech about the Arab Spring, and, hoping to break the stalemate in the peace talks, he said, \u201cThe borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps.\u201d The 1967 borders, with some adjustments, had long been recognized as the foundation for a peace agreement, but Obama was the first President to utter the words so explicitly. The next day, Netanyahu arrived in Washington and rebuked him in the Oval Office, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to those indefensible lines.\u201d A veteran Israeli politician was aghast at Netanyahu\u2019s performance. \u201cThis is the President of the United States of America, and you are the head of a client state\u2014let\u2019s not forget that!\u201d he said. \u201cAIPAC should have come to Bibi and said, \u2018You don\u2019t talk to the President the way you do! This is not done, you have to stop it!\u2019 Instead of reflecting almost automatically everything the Israeli government is doing and pushing in that direction.\u201d AIPAC officially supports a two-state solution, but many of its members, and many of the speakers at its conferences, loudly oppose such an agreement. Tom Dine has said that the lobby\u2019s tacit position is \u201cWe\u2019ll work against it until it happens.\u201d After Obama endorsed the 1967 borders, AIPAC members called Congress to express outrage. \u201cThey wanted the President to feel the heat from Israel\u2019s friends on the Hill,\u201d a former Israeli official recalled. \u201cThey were saying to the Administration, \u2018You must rephrase, you must correct!\u2019 \u201d When Obama appeared at an AIPAC policy conference three days later, he was conciliatory: \u201cThe parties themselves\u2014Israelis and Palestinians\u2014will negotiate a border that is different than the one that existed on June 4, 1967. That\u2019s what \u2018mutually agreed-upon swaps\u2019 means.\u201d AIPAC had e-mailed videos to attendees, urging them not to boo the President; they complied, offering occasional wan applause. The next day, Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress and received twenty-nine standing ovations. Fifty years ago, before Israel became an undeclared nuclear power and its existence was under threat, any differences it had with the U.S. were usually aired in private. Today, the political dynamics in both countries\u2014and the particulars of the relationship\u2014have evolved. A majority of Israelis still favor the idea of a two-state solution, but the political mood has shifted markedly to the right. The reasons range from the deeply felt notion that the Palestinians were \u201coffered the world and rejected it\u201d to the rise of Hamas in Gaza, from the aftershock of terror attacks a decade ago to the instability throughout the Middle East. Likud has rejected relative moderates like Dan Meridor and Benny Begin; Netanyahu himself is considered a \u201cdove\u201d by some leaders of his coalition and members of his party. The consensus deepens that Oslo was a failure, and that, as Netanyahu says, \u201cthere is no partner for peace.\u201d The Palestinians, for their part, argue that the settlements in the West Bank and Jewish expansion into East Jerusalem have created a \u201cone-state reality.\u201d They point out that members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition reject a two-state solution\u2014\u201cThe land is ours!\u201d\u2014and endorse permanent Israeli control, or outright annexation, of the West Bank. Netanyahu prides himself on understanding the American political climate. But his deepest relationships are with older, often wealthy members of the establishments in New York and Los Angeles, and he is less conscious of the changes in American demographics and in opinion among younger American Jews. Assaf Sharon, the research director of Molad, a progressive think tank in Jerusalem, said, \u201cWhen Israelis see House members jump like springs to applaud every lame comment Bibi utters, they think he is a star in Washington. Then they are told by the local pundits that everything else is just personal friction with Obama. My sense is that the people surrounding Bibi\u2014and the Prime Minister himself\u2014don\u2019t appreciate the significance of the shift.\u201d Buy a cartoon Yet the rhetoric of Netanyahu\u2019s circle has never been more confident. In a recent talk, Dermer argued that Israel is a regional superpower, with much to give in its relationship with the U.S. \u201cAmerica\u2019s most important ally in the twentieth century was Great Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cYour most important ally in the twenty-first century is going to be the State of Israel.\u201d In a meeting with young Likud supporters last spring, which one of them transcribed online, Netanyahu boasted of defying Obama\u2019s pressure to halt settlements; 2013 was a record year for settlement construction in the West Bank. He preferred to \u201cstand up to international pressure by maneuvering,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is that we continue to head straight toward our goal, even if one time we walk right and another time walk left.\u201d When one of the Likudniks asked about peace talks with the Palestinians, Netanyahu is said to have replied, as the audience laughed, \u201cAbout the\u2014what?\u201d AIPAC\u2019s hold on Congress has become institutionalized. Each year, a month or two before the annual policy conference, AIPAC officials tell key members what measures they want, so that their activists have something to lobby for. \u201cEvery year, we create major legislation, so they can justify their existence to their members,\u201d the former congressional aide said. (AIPAC maintains that only members of Congress initiate legislative action.) AIPAC board meetings are held in Washington each month, and directors visit members of Congress. They generally address them by their first names, even if they haven\u2019t met before. The intimacy is presumed, but also, at times, earned; local AIPAC staffers, in the manner of basketball recruiters, befriend some members when they are still serving on the student council. \u201cIf you have a dream about running for office, AIPAC calls you,\u201d one House member said. Certainly, it\u2019s a rarity when someone undertakes a campaign for the House or the Senate today without hearing from AIPAC. In 1996, Brian Baird, a psychologist from Seattle, decided to run for Congress. Local Democrats asked if he had thought about what he was going to say to AIPAC. \u201cI had admired Israel since I was a kid,\u201d Baird told me. \u201cBut I also was fairly sympathetic to peaceful resolution and the Palestinian side. These people said, \u2018We respect that, but let\u2019s talk about the issues and what you might say.\u2019 The difficult reality is this: in order to get elected to Congress, if you\u2019re not independently wealthy, you have to raise a lot of money. And you learn pretty quickly that, if AIPAC is on your side, you can do that. They come to you and say, \u2018We\u2019d be happy to host ten-thousand-dollar fund-raisers for you, and let us help write your annual letter, and please come to this multi-thousand-person dinner.\u2019 \u201d Baird continued, \u201cAny member of Congress knows that AIPAC is associated indirectly with significant amounts of campaign spending if you\u2019re with them, and significant amounts against you if you\u2019re not with them.\u201d For Baird, AIPAC-connected money amounted to about two hundred thousand dollars in each of his races\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s two hundred thousand going your way, versus the other way: a four-hundred-thousand-dollar swing.\u201d The contributions, as with many interest groups, come with a great deal of tactical input. \u201cThe AIPAC people do a very good job of \u2018informing\u2019 you about the issues,\u201d Baird told me. \u201cIt literally gets down to \u2018No, we don\u2019t say it that way, we say it this way.\u2019 Always phrased as a friendly suggestion\u2014but it\u2019s pretty clear you don\u2019t want to say \u2018occupied territories\u2019! There\u2019s a whole complex semantic code you learn. . . . After a while, you find yourself saying and repeating it as if it were fact.\u201d Soon after taking office, Baird went on a \u201cvirtually obligatory\u201d trip to Israel: a freshman ritual in which everything\u2014business-class flights, accommodations at the King David or the Citadel\u2014is paid for by AIPAC\u2019s charitable arm. The tours are carefully curated. \u201cThey do have you meet with the Palestinian leaders, in a sort of token process,\u201d Baird said. \u201cBut then when you\u2019re done with it they tell you everything the Palestinian leaders said that\u2019s wrong. And, of course, the Palestinians don\u2019t get to have dinner with you at the hotel that night.\u201d In early 2009, after a brief truce between Israel and Hamas collapsed in a series of mutual provocations, Israel carried out Operation Cast Lead, an incursion into Gaza in which nearly fourteen hundred Palestinians were killed, along with thirteen Israelis. Baird visited the area a few weeks later and returned several times. As he wrote in an op-ed, he saw \u201cfirsthand the devastating destruction of hospitals, schools, homes, industries, and infrastructure.\u201d That September, the U.N. Human Rights Council issued a report, based on an inquiry led by the South African jurist Richard Goldstone, that accused Israel of a series of possible war crimes. AIPAC attacked the report, saying it was \u201crigged.\u201d A month later, an AIPAC-sponsored resolution to condemn the report was introduced in the House, and three hundred and forty-four members voted in favor. \u201cI read every single word of that report, and it comported with what I had seen and heard on the ground in Gaza,\u201d Baird said. \u201cWhen we had the vote, I said, \u2018We have member after member coming to the floor to vote on a resolution they\u2019ve never read, about a report they\u2019ve never seen, in a place they\u2019ve never been.\u2019 \u201d Goldstone came under such pressure that threats were made to ban him from his grandson\u2019s bar mitzvah at a Johannesburg synagogue. He eventually wrote an op-ed in which he expressed regret for his conclusions, saying, \u201cCivilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy.\u201d Other members of the council stood by the report. In 2010, Baird decided not to run again for the House; he is now the president of Antioch University Seattle. Few current members of Congress are as outspoken about AIPAC as Baird. Staff members fret about whether AIPAC will prevent them from getting a good consulting job when they leave government. \u201cYou just hear the name!\u201d a Senate aide said. \u201cYou hear that they are involved and everyone\u2019s ears perk up and their mood changes, and they start to fall in line in a certain way.\u201d Baird said, \u201cWhen key votes are cast, the question on the House floor, troublingly, is often not \u2018What is the right thing to do for the United States of America?\u2019 but \u2018How is AIPAC going to score this?\u2019 \u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s such a conundrum here, of believing that you\u2019re supporting Israel, when you\u2019re actually backing policies that are antithetical to its highest values and, ultimately, destructive for the country.\u201d In talks with Israeli officials, he found that his inquiries were not treated with much respect. In 2003, one of his constituents, Rachel Corrie, was killed by a bulldozer driven by an Israeli soldier, as she protested the demolition of Palestinians\u2019 homes in Gaza. At first, he said, the officials told him, \u201cThere\u2019s a simple explanation\u2014here are the facts.\u201d Or, \u201cWe will look into it.\u201d But, when he continued to press, something else would emerge. \u201cThere is a disdain for the U.S., and a dismissal of any legitimacy of our right to question\u2014because who are we to talk about moral values?\u201d Baird told me. \u201cWhether it\u2019s that we didn\u2019t help early enough in the Holocaust, or look at what we did to our African-Americans, or our Native Americans\u2014whatever! And they see us, members of Congress, as basically for sale. So they want us to shut up and play the game.\u201d \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t see the big deal about the ice-bucket challenge.\u201d Buy a cartoon In 2007, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, two leading political scientists of the realist school, published a book called \u201cThe Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy.\u201d The book, a best-seller, presented a scathing portrait of AIPAC, arguing that the lobby had a nearly singular distorting influence on American foreign policy, and even that it was a central factor in the rush to war in Iraq. While the authors\u2019 supporters praised their daring, their critics argued that they had neglected to point out any failures of the Palestinian leadership, and painted AIPAC in conspiratorial, omnipotent tones. Even Noam Chomsky, a fierce critic of Israel from the left, wrote that the authors had exaggerated the influence of AIPAC, and that other special interests, like the energy lobby, had greater influence on Middle East policy. A broader political challenge to AIPAC came in 2009, with the founding of J Street, a \u201cpro-Israel, pro-peace\u201d advocacy group. Led by Jeremy Ben-Ami, a former Clinton Administration aide whose grandparents were among the first settlers in Tel Aviv, J Street was founded to appeal to American Jews who strongly support a two-state solution and who see the occupation as a threat to democracy and to Jewish values. J Street has only a tiny fraction of AIPAC\u2019s financial power and influence on Capitol Hill, but it has tried to provide at least some campaign funding to weaken the lobby\u2019s grip. AIPAC and its allies have responded aggressively. This year, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations voted not to admit J Street, because, as the leader of one Orthodox alliance said to the Times, its \u201cpositions are out of the mainstream of what could be considered acceptable within the Jewish community.\u201d Danny Ayalon, the former Israeli Ambassador, told me, \u201cWhen Jewish organizations join the political campaign to delegitimatize Israel, they are really undermining our security collectively. Because I do believe that, if Israel\u2019s security is compromised, so is that of every Jew in the world.\u201d Many Israeli and Palestinian leaders have taken note of the rise of J Street and, without overestimating its capacities, see that it represents an increasing diversity of opinion in the American Jewish community. At the last J Street convention, in Washington, Husam Zomlot, a rising figure in Fatah, the largest faction in the P.L.O., delivered a speech about the Palestinian cause and got a standing ovation. \u201cAIPAC is not as effective as it was,\u201d Zomlot said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say J Street is the mainstream representative of Jewish Americans, but it is a trend that gives you some sense of where things are and what is happening. Though it has limited funding, it is the first organized Jewish group with a different agenda in Washington since Israel was established. It\u2019s worth noticing.\u201d Some politicians in Washington have indeed noticed, and not always to their benefit. Soon after J Street got started, it endorsed Robert Wexler, a Democratic congressman who represented a South Florida district. \u201cSome AIPAC people told me they would not support me anymore if I went to a J Street event or took their support,\u201d Wexler recalled. \u201cI called them and said, \u2018You\u2019ve supported me for twelve years. You\u2019re not going to support me because somebody from J Street endorsed me?\u2019 \u201d Wexler added, \u201cAIPAC is still by a factor of a hundred to one the premier lobbying organization for the Jewish community. I\u2019ll never understand why they care one iota about J Street\u2014but they have this bizarre fixation on it.\u201d Jan Schakowsky, who has represented a liberal Chicago district since 1999, was another of J Street\u2019s first endorsees. For years, she had maintained good relations with AIPAC, whose members * gave money to her campaigns and praised her positions. She voted to condemn the Goldstone report and signed a 2010 letter urging the Administration to keep any differences with Israel private. But in her 2010 race, she was challenged by Joel Pollak, an Orthodox Jew, who argued that she was insufficiently supportive of Israel. \u201cWe were very much aware that AIPAC-associated people were fund-raising for Jan\u2019s opponent,\u201d Dylan Williams, the director of government affairs for J Street, said. A small but vocal contingent of AIPAC members were behind Pollak. But he was also backed by the Tea Party, which J Street believed might drive away other Jewish voters. The new lobby raised seventy-five thousand dollars for Schakowsky (through its PAC, whose financial contributions are publicly disclosed), and she won by a wide margin. \u201cIt was exactly the type of race we had hoped for!\u201d Williams said. \u201cA lot of the power of AIPAC is based on this perception, which I believe is a myth, that if you cross their line you will be targeted, and your opponent in your next race will receive all this money, and it will make a difference.\u201d Still, Schakowsky told me, the process was painful. \u201cGetting booed in a synagogue was not a pleasure,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not just my base\u2014it\u2019s my family!\u201d She added, \u201cIncreasingly, Israel has become a wedge issue, something to be used against the President by the Republicans, and it can be very unhelpful.\u201d AIPAC is still capable of mounting a show of bipartisanship. At this year\u2019s policy conference, Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic Whip, appeared onstage with Eric Cantor, then the Republican House Majority Leader, and together they rhapsodized about the summer trip they routinely took, leading groups of mostly freshmen on an AIPAC tour of Israel. \u201cFew things are as meaningful as watching your colleagues discover the Jewish state for the very first time,\u201d Cantor said. Hoyer offered a benediction: \u201cWe Baptists would say, \u2018Amen.\u2019 \u201d Cantor and Hoyer have been steadfast supporters of AIPAC, and its members have held at least a dozen fund-raisers for them each year. But last December AIPAC\u2019s efforts to implement sanctions against Iran were so intense that even this well-tempered partnership fractured. When Congress returned from its Thanksgiving recess, legislators in the House began discussing a sanctions bill. According to the former congressional aide, Cantor told Hoyer that he wanted a bill that would kill the interim agreement with Iran. Hoyer refused, saying that he would collaborate only on a nonbinding resolution. Cantor sent Hoyer a resolution that called for additional sanctions and sought to define in advance the contours of an agreement with Iran. \u201cThe pressure was tremendous\u2014not just AIPAC leadership and legislative officials but various board members and other contributors, from all over the country,\u201d the former congressional aide recalled. \u201cWhat was striking was how strident the message was,\u201d another aide said. \u201c \u2018How could you not pass a resolution that tells the President what the outcome of the negotiations has to be?\u2019 \u201d Advocates for the sanctions portrayed Obama as feckless. \u201cThey said, \u2018Iranians have been doing this for millennia. They can smell weakness. Why is the President showing weakness?\u2019 \u201d a Senate aide recalled. AIPAC was betting that the Democrats, facing midterms with an unpopular President, would break ranks, and that Obama would be unable to stop them. Its confidence was not unfounded; every time Netanyahu and AIPAC had opposed Obama, he had retreated. But Obama took up the fight with unusual vigor. He has been deeply interested in nonproliferation since his college days, and he has been searching for an opening with Iran since his Presidential campaign in 2008. As the Cantor-Hoyer resolution gathered momentum, House Democrats began holding meetings at the White House to strategize about how to oppose it. \u201cWait\u2014I almost forgot why I called.\u201d April 18, 2005 Buy a cartoon Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the head of the Democratic National Committee, attended the meetings, at some political risk. Wasserman Schultz represents a heavily Jewish district in South Florida, and has been a reliable signature on AIPAC\u2019s letters and resolutions; she has boasted of concurring with a hundred per cent of its positions. Now the lobby e-mailed out an \u201cAIPAC Action Alert,\u201d including the text of a story about the meetings in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, in which she was described as \u201csiding with the Mullahs over the American people.\u201d The alert asked AIPAC\u2019s executive-council members to contact her office, ask if the story was true, and challenge her opposition to Cantor-Hoyer. Stephen Fiske, the chair of the pro-Israel Florida Congressional Committee PAC, sent a similar alert to Wasserman Schultz\u2019s constituents, setting off a cascade of calls to her office. (Fiske told the Free Beacon that the callers included a team of young students: his son\u2019s classmates at a Jewish day school in North Miami Beach.) Wasserman Schultz was furious. Soon afterward, she flew to Israel for the funeral of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. On the trip, she remarked to a colleague, \u201cThey\u2019re doing this to me?\u201d But as the meetings continued Democrats began to build a consensus. In December, Ester Kurz, AIPAC\u2019s director of legislative strategy, went to see Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader, to urge her to pass the resolution. Pelosi resisted, pointing out that many members of Hoyer\u2019s caucus strongly opposed it. David Price, a Democrat, and Charles Dent, a Republican, had written a letter to the President, urging him to use the diplomatic opening that followed Rouhani\u2019s election to attempt a nuclear agreement; it garnered a hundred and thirty-one signatures. Pointing to the letter, Pelosi demanded to know why AIPAC wanted this resolution, at this time. The members of Hoyer\u2019s caucus pressed him, and, on December 12th, just as the language of the resolution became final, he asked to set aside the effort, saying that the time was not right. His demurral\u2014from someone who had rarely disappointed AIPAC\u2014was a sign that the lobby might be in uncharted terrain. Two weeks after local AIPAC activists pressured Wasserman Schultz, a national board member issued a statement that called her \u201ca good friend of Israel and a close friend of AIPAC.\u201d The crucial fight, though, was in the Senate. A couple of days before the Christmas recess, Robert Menendez and Mark Kirk introduced their sanctions bill, the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013. At first, senators were eager to express support\u2014previous Iran-sanctions bills had passed by votes of 99\u20130\u2014and, by the second week of January, Menendez and Kirk had secured the votes of fifty-nine senators, including sixteen Democrats. One more vote would enable the bill\u2019s supporters to overcome a filibuster. A number of senators facing re\u00eblection were told by AIPAC contacts that fund-raisers would be cancelled if they did not sign on, according to several employees of another lobby. (AIPAC denies this.) In January, though, AIPAC\u2019s effort stalled. Some senators complained that the bill called for immediate sanctions. In fact, a close reading of the bill makes plain that most of the sanctions would become active ninety days after enactment. But the sanctions, ostensibly intended to put pressure on the Iranian negotiators, were designed to go into effect automatically, no matter how the nuclear talks went. The bill also dictated to negotiators the acceptable terms of an agreement, and committed the U.S. to support any defensive military action that Israel took against Iran. On the Senate floor, Dianne Feinstein gave a pointed speech, in which she warned that, if the bill passed, \u201cdiplomatic negotiations will collapse,\u201d and said, \u201cWe cannot let Israel determine when and where the United States goes to war.\u201d Ten Senate committee chairmen\u2014including Feinstein, who serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence, and Carl Levin, of Michigan, the head of the Armed Services Committee\u2014wrote to Harry Reid, noting that the intelligence community believed that new sanctions would effectively halt the negotiations. At the same time, AIPAC was urging Reid to bring the measure to a vote\u2014and, as the former congressional aide noted, \u201cyou don\u2019t alienate a key fund-raising base, especially when you may be about to lose the Senate.\u201d But the pressure from the White House was even greater. Brad Gordon, AIPAC\u2019s longtime legislative official, said ruefully, \u201cI have not seen the Administration act with such force and such sustained effort . . . since Obama became President.\u201d At a meeting with several dozen Democratic senators in January, Obama spoke at length about Iran, warning of the possibility of war. Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, said later that the President \u201cwas as good as I\u2019ve ever heard him.\u201d As congressional Democrats continued to meet in the White House Obama\u2019s press secretary, Jay Carney, referred to the proposed sanctions as part of a \u201cmarch to war.\u201d Not long afterward, Bernadette Meehan, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said, \u201cIf certain members of Congress want the United States to take military action, they should be up front with the American public and say so.\u201d Congressional offices were inundated with calls from constituents alarmed by the prospect of war. The decisive moment came in the State of the Union speech, when Obama said plainly, \u201cIf this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.\u201d About a week later, forty-two Republican senators sent a letter to Reid, demanding that he bring Menendez-Kirk to a vote, and noting that he had already \u201ctaken unprecedented steps to take away the rights of the minority in the Senate.\u201d Reid\u2019s staff members urged AIPAC officials to stop pressing for the bill; their office had been open to a bipartisan process, they argued, but siding with the Republicans against Obama was hardly bipartisan. According to a former Senate aide, the lobbyists seemed to realize that if they continued to push they would have to give up any claim to bipartisanship. Two days later, AIPAC issued a statement saying that the time was not right for a vote; Menendez issued a similar statement. \u201cThat was the fundamental moment when Menendez-Kirk lost,\u201d the aide said. AIPAC had sustained a painful defeat\u2014and its annual policy conference was only a few weeks away. The day before the conference, according to a senior House Democrat, \u201cAIPAC still did not have its \u2018ask\u2019 together.\u201d Instead of dictating the terms of legislation, the lobby struggled to negotiate letters to the President, urging him to support sanctions. In the end, Cantor and Hoyer\u2019s resolution was reduced to a letter, circulated in the House, that was so anodyne that most Democrats in the progressive caucus signed it. Some of the House Democrats who had fought against the resolution were enjoying a new sense of confidence. For a month, David Price and his fellow-Democrat Lloyd Doggett had been gathering support for a letter to the President, saying that Congress should \u201cgive diplomacy a chance.\u201d They expected to get perhaps forty signatures. Instead, they got a hundred and four, including those of four Republicans. \u201cAIPAC tried to peel some away, but what\u2019s striking is how few we lost,\u201d Price said. A handful of Jewish members signed, including Jan Schakowsky. Wasserman Schultz did not. \u201cIt was a difficult policy spot for all of us, as Jewish members,\u201d Schakowsky said. But, had the Cantor-Hoyer resolution passed, she continued, \u201cit would have created an atmosphere surrounding the bargaining table that the President could not bargain in good faith. And it would for the first time have dramatically divided the Democrats.\u201d John Yarmuth, of Kentucky, another Jewish member who signed the letter, said, \u201cAIPAC clearly has a great deal of clout in the Republican conference, and many Democrats still think that they have to be responsive to it.\u201d But he believes that the letter was an important measure of congressional restiveness. \u201cI think there is a growing sense among members that things are done just to placate AIPAC, and that AIPAC is not really working to advance what is in the interest of the United States.\u201d He concluded, \u201cWe all took an oath of office. And AIPAC, in many instances, is asking us to ignore it.\u201d A few months later, the Gaza war began, and AIPAC mobilized again. \u201cThere were conference calls, mass e-mails, talking points for the day,\u201d a congressional aide said. \u201cAIPAC activists would e-mail me, with fifteen other AIPAC activists cc\u2019d, and then those people would respond, saying, \u2018I agree entirely with what the first e-mail said!\u2019 \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got those Stuck-in-the-Subway-Listening-to-a-Guy-Massacre-Dylan Blues.\u201d October 25, 2010 Buy a cartoon It didn\u2019t hurt AIPAC\u2019s cause that the enemy was Hamas, whose suicide bombings a decade ago killed hundreds of Israeli civilians, and whose rocket attacks in recent years have terrorized citizens, particularly in southern Israel. As Israel pressed its offensive, and hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed, AIPAC argued, as did Netanyahu, that the casualties came only because Hamas was using human shields. Online, AIPAC posted a short film, \u201cIsrael\u2019s Moral Defense,\u201d which depicted an Israeli major in a quandary. Looking at a schoolyard filled with girls in neat uniforms, he sees fighters with a rocket launcher not far behind them. Should he order his men to fire their machine guns, and risk hitting the girls, or hold back, and risk the rocket killing Israelis? \u201cI didn\u2019t pull the trigger,\u201d the soldier says. \u201cWe are totally different. . . . I am very proud to be in an army that has this level of morality.\u201d A couple of weeks after the film appeared, Israeli shells struck a United Nations school in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing twenty-one people and injuring more than ninety; it was the sixth U.N. school that Israel had bombed. The next day, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, pointed out that, as Israeli forces attacked homes, schools, and hospitals, the U.S. was supplying them with heavy weaponry. Almost simultaneously, the House passed an AIPAC-supported resolution denouncing Hamas\u2019s use of human shields and condemning an inquiry into Israel\u2019s Gaza operations that Pillay was sponsoring. According to congressional staffers, some members of Congress seemed eager to make up for their recent apostasy on the Iran negotiations. While Reid and his colleagues went to extraordinary lengths to fund the Iron Dome missile-defense system, the House leadership engaged in the same mission. The vote in the House came late on the night of Friday, August 1st\u2014the last possible moment before the summer recess. The earlier resolutions that AIPAC had sponsored during the war had passed unanimously, with no record of individual votes, but on this vote the roll was called. (AIPAC sometimes asks congressional leaders to call the roll when a decisive victory seems likely.) \u201cI think AIPAC thought this vote would be one hundred per cent,\u201d Jim Moran, a Democrat from Virginia, said. It was close: out of four hundred and thirty-five members, only eight voted no. Moran, who has been in Congress since 1990, and is retiring this year, was one of four Democrats who voted against the resolution. As a longtime member of the Defense Appropriations Committee, he did not believe that there was any urgent need for the funding. \u201cWe have put about nine hundred million dollars into the Iron Dome,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe know that there are many millions unexpended in Israel\u2019s Iron Dome account. And Israel was to get three hundred and fifty-one million on October 1st, for Iron Dome.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, a freshman Democrat from El Paso, also voted against the funding. \u201cI tried to find him on the floor, but I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Moran said. \u201cI wanted him to switch his vote. Now, he might not have switched it anyway, because\u2014as shocking as it may be\u2014he\u2019s in Congress solely to do what he considers to be the right thing. I\u2019m afraid he may have a tough race in November.\u201d The morning after the vote, O\u2019Rourke e-mailed a local AIPAC activist, Stuart Schwartz, to explain his vote, according to a knowledgeable person. In his explanation, which he also posted on Facebook, he pointed out that he had voted for Iron Dome in the past, and had supported the funds that were scheduled to arrive in October. But, he wrote, \u201cI could not in good conscience vote for borrowing $225 million more to send to Israel, without debate and without discussion, in the midst of a war that has cost more than a thousand civilian lives already, too many of them children.\u201d Within hours, O\u2019Rourke was flooded with e-mails, texts, and calls. The next day, the El Paso Times ran a front-page story with the headline \u201cO\u2019ROURKE VOTE DRAWS CRITICISM.\u201d In the story, Stuart Schwartz, who is described as having donated a thousand dollars to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s previous campaign, commented that O\u2019Rourke \u201cchooses to side with the rocket launchers and terror tunnel builders.\u201d A mass e-mail circulated, reading \u201cThe Following Is Shameful, El Paso Has an Anti-Israel Congressman. . . . Do Not Re\u00eblect Beto O\u2019Rourke.\u201d At the bottom was the address of AIPAC\u2019s Web site, and a snippet of text: \u201cAIPAC is directly responsible for the overwhelming support this legislation received on the Hill. If you are not a member of AIPAC, I strongly recommend that you join. Every dollar helps fund this important work in Congress.\u201d The day that Congress passed the Iron Dome bills happened to be an especially deadly one in Gaza. In the city of Rafah, Israeli troops pursued Hamas fighters with such overwhelming force that about a hundred and fifty Palestinians were killed, many of them women and children. Israel\u2019s critics in the region have been energized. Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator, told me that Congress had sent a clear message by funding Iron Dome that day. \u201cCongress was telling Israel, \u2018You go ahead and kill, and we will fund it for you.\u2019 \u201d She argued that Israelis had dominated American political discourse on the war, as they have for decades on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \u201cThey say, \u2018The Palestinians are all terrorists, they are the people we don\u2019t know, they are alien, foreign, strange\u2014but Israelis are like us.\u2019 Who shaped the presentation, in the U.S.? AIPAC, to a large degree.\u201d Yet the war has broad support in Israel. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, just six per cent of the Jewish population believes that the Israeli Army has used excessive force. Of those who expressed an opinion, almost half believe that the force has not been severe enough. The left, finding itself increasingly isolated, is deeply critical of AIPAC. Zeev Sternhell, a leading Israeli intellectual and an expert on European fascism, told me, \u201cI consider AIPAC\u2019s role to have been absolutely disastrous, because it prevents any possibility to move with the Palestinians. We cannot move without American intervention\u2014but we are more or less free of American intervention. This is AIPAC\u2019s job. So the present coalition has this sentiment of impunity.\u201d In the U.S., the war has created tense disagreement, dividing left and right, young and old. Congress showed no such uncertainty, which is a triumph for AIPAC. But the lobby also faces an inevitable question about the extent to which young liberals like O\u2019Rourke represent the future. When I asked Dore Gold, an external adviser to the Netanyahu government, about AIPAC\u2019s prospects, he spoke in determinedly upbeat tones, dismissing the Iran-sanctions episode. \u201cA political loss does not necessarily mean that a political organization has reached its sunset years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the contrary, it can give added motivation for people who are concerned with the implications of Iran crossing the nuclear threshold.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cwhen issues become so partisan, it is harder for an organization like AIPAC. You have to fight that.\u201d For decades, AIPAC has maintained a hugely successful model, creating widespread support from an unlikely base, and tapping into a seemingly endless wellspring of support from the American Jewish community. But bipartisanship is a relic now, and a generation of unquestioning adherents is aging. Like its embattled allies in Congress, AIPAC needs to reach constituents who represent the country as it will look in the coming decades. At AIPAC\u2019s policy conference last March, Olga Miranda, the president of S.E.I.U. Local 87, gazed out at the crowd that filled the darkened Washington Convention Center\u2014a gathering she dubbed the \u201cJewish Super Bowl.\u201d Large video screens displayed her image. A lively woman with long black hair and a commanding voice, Miranda proclaimed, \u201cI am a union leader, I am Joaquin\u2019s mother, I am one of nine children raised by a single mother, I am a Chicana\u2014and I am AIPAC!\u201d For years, she explained, her information about the Middle East had come from television, and she sympathized with the Palestinians, until one day she got a call from someone at AIPAC who asked her if she\u2019d be interested in a trip to Israel. That trip changed her life, she said. Now she argues about Israel with her friends and colleagues. \u201cSee you on the picket lines!\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a comedy, so I\u2019ve had Steve, here, red-flag the funny parts.\u201d December 22, 2003 Buy a cartoon \u201cThe face of pro-Israel activists has changed pretty dramatically,\u201d David Victor, a former AIPAC president, told me. In the past eight years, AIPAC has reached out to Hispanics, African-Americans, and evangelical Christians, in the hope that greater diversity will translate into continued support in Congress. Victor pointed out that this year\u2019s AIPAC conference was bigger than ever. In 2008, when he was president, eight thousand members attended; this year, there were fourteen thousand, including two hundred and sixty student-government presidents. \u201cThese are future opinion leaders,\u201d he said. Those opinion leaders face a difficult task when they return to campus. Many young American Jews believe that criticism is vital to Israel\u2019s survival as a democratic state. Some are even helping to support a campaign known as B.D.S., for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, which is aimed at ending the occupation and recognizing the rights of Palestinian refugees and citizens. In June, the U.S. branch of the Presbyterian church voted to divest from three companies seen as profiting from the military occupation of the West Bank. (One was Caterpillar, the construction-equipment company, which Rachel Corrie\u2019s parents had sued, unsuccessfully.) The church took care to affirm Israel\u2019s right to exist and to disavow an endorsement of the B.D.S. movement. J Street, likewise, has said that B.D.S. can be \u201ca convenient mantle for thinly disguised anti-Semitism.\u201d But the movement persists, particularly on campuses and in left-wing circles. Ironically, there is also a threat to AIPAC from the right. Many American conservatives were enraged by the perception that AIPAC had surrendered in the fight for Iran sanctions. Shortly after Menendez set aside his efforts to pass the bill, AIPAC issued a statement vowing to try again later. \u201cThey did that because there was an eruption from the other side,\u201d a former Senate aide said. \u201c \u2018How could you sell out the Republican caucus, when we were advocating exactly what Bibi Netanyahu was!\u2019 \u201d Republicans were frustrated by the lobby\u2019s refusal to move forward at the expense of Democrats, the aide said: \u201cI know AIPAC has its commitment to bipartisanship. But what good is that commitment if in the end you don\u2019t achieve your policy objective?\u201d For AIPAC\u2019s most severe conservative critics, its attempts to occupy a diminishing sliver of middle ground are unacceptable. Recently, Sheldon Adelson, who funded AIPAC\u2019s new office building a few years ago, has been increasing his support for the right-wing Zionist Organization of America. Mort Klein, the head of the Z.O.A., told me, \u201cAdelson is not happy with AIPAC, clearly.\u201d Several people affiliated with the right-wing Jewish movement told me that significant donors are talking about founding a new organization. Caught between the increasingly right-leaning Israel and the increasingly fractious United States, AIPAC has little space to maneuver. Wittmann, the spokesman, said, \u201cOur positions in support of the Oslo process and the two-state solution have generated criticism from some on the right, just as our stand for strong prospective Iran sanctions has spurred criticism from some on the left\u201d\u2014a statement of bipartisan intent, but also of the difficulty of contemporary politics. Recently, the lobby has begun another outreach effort, focussed on progressive Democrats. At the conference, Olga Miranda and Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 Presidential campaign, spoke on a panel called \u201cThe Progressive Case for Israel.\u201d Lewis told me that she has recently been involved in conversations with AIPAC staff and board members about finding ways to improve AIPAC\u2019s connections with progressive Democrats. \u201cThey are exploring how to reach progressives, but they\u2019re lost on this!\u201d a leader in the pro-Israel community who is knowledgeable about the effort said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to bridge the gap. People see AIPAC as representing issues that are anathema to them. It\u2019s an enormous challenge.\u201d At the conference, the extent of the challenge was clear. Even Netanyahu seemed struck by the mood. At one point in his speech, he said, \u201cI hope that the Palestinian leadership will stand with Israel and the United States on the right side of the moral divide, the side of peace, reconciliation, and hope.\u201d The audience members responded with scant, listless applause. \u201cYou can clap,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u2666 * An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Jan Schakowsky\u2019s campaigns received funding from the AIPAC organization.

      "text": "Twitter By Anthony Savignano. Unfortunately for Donald and Ivana Trump, all that glittered wasn\u2019t gold. But the reign of New York\u2019s self-created imperial couple isn\u2019t over yet. Donald\u2019s Midas touch may be tarnished, but the banks are still throwing money at him, while Ivana is busy brokering a future of her own. Marie Brenner reports on how the Trumps are still going for it all. by Marie Brenner \n\u2018We have an old custom here at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Donald Trump was saying one night at dinner in his 118-room winter palace in Palm Beach. \u201cOur custom is to go around the table after dinner and introduce ourselves to each other.\u201d Trump had seemed fidgety that night, understandably eager to move the dinner party along so that he could go to bed. \n\u201cOld custom? He\u2019s only had Mrs. Post\u2019s house a few months. Really! I\u2019m going home,\u201d one Palm Beach resident whispered to his date. \n\u201cOh, stay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be so amusing.\u201d \nIt was spring, four years ago. Donald and Ivana Trump were seated at opposite ends of their long Sheraton table in Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post\u2019s former dining room. They were posed in imperial style, as if they were a king and queen. They were at the height of their ride, and it was plenty glorious. Trump was seen on the news shows offering his services to negotiate with the Russians. There was talk that he might make a run for president. Ivana had had so much publicity that she now offered interviewers a press kit of flattering clips. Anything seemed possible, the Trumps had grown to such stature in the golden city of New York. \nIt was balmy that night in Palm Beach; Ivana wore a strapless dress. The air was redolent with the fragrance of oleander and bougainvillea, mingled with the slight smell of mildew which clung to the old house. To his credit, Trump had no interest in mastering the Palm Beach style of navy blazers and linen trousers. Often he wore a business suit to his table; his only concession to local custom was to wear a pink tie or pale shoes. To her credit, Ivana still served the dinners her husband preferred, so on that warm night the guests ate beef with potatoes. Mrs. Post\u2019s faux-Tiepolo ceiling remained in the dining room, but an immense silver bowl now rested in the center of the table, filled with plastic fruit. As always, it was business with the Trumps, for that was their common purpose, the bond between them. In recent years, they never seemed to touch each other or exchange intimate remarks in public. They had become less like man and wife and more like two ambassadors from different countries, each with a separate agenda. \nThe Trumps had bought Mar-a-Lago only a few months earlier, but already they had become Palm Beach curiosities. Across the road was the Bath and Tennis Club, \u201cthe B and T,\u201d as the locals called it, and it was said that the Trumps had yet to be invited to join. \u201cUtter bullshit! They kiss my ass in Palm Beach,\u201d Trump told me recently. \u201cThose phonies! That club called me and asked me if they could have my consent to use part of my beach to expand the space for their cabanas! I said, \u2018Of course!\u2019 Do you think if I wanted to be a member they would have turned me down? I wouldn\u2019t join that club, because they don\u2019t take blacks and Jews.\u201d \nAs if Mar-a-Lago and the Trump Princess yacht were James Gatz\u2019s West Egg estate, invitations were much prized, for the local snobs loved to dine out on tales of the Trumps. And now this! Embarrassing their guests by having them make speeches, as if they were at a sales convention! \nWhen it was Ivana\u2019s turn to introduce herself that night, she rose quickly. \u201cI am married to the most wonderful husband. He is so generous and smart. We are so lucky to have this life.\u201d She was desperately playing to him, but Donald said nothing in return. He seemed tired of hearing Ivana\u2019s endless praise; her subservient quality appeared to be getting to him. Perhaps he was spoiling for something to excite him, like a fight. Maybe all the public posturing was beginning to get boring, too. \u201cWell, I\u2019m done,\u201d he said before dessert, tossing his napkin on the table and vanishing from the room. \nPalm Beach had been Ivana Trump\u2019s idea. Long ago, Donald had screamed at her, \u201cI want nothing social that you aspire to. If that is what makes you happy, get another husband!\u201d But she had no intention of doing that, for Ivana, like Donald, was living out a fantasy. She had seen that in the Trump life everything and everybody appeared to come with a price, or a marker for future use. Ivana had learned to look through Donald with glazed eyes when he said to close friends, as he had in the early years of their marriage, \u201cI would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?\u201d She had gotten out of Eastern Europe by being tough and highly disciplined, and she had compounded her skills through her husband, the master manipulator. She had learned the lingua franca in a world where everyone seemed to be using everyone else in a relentless drive for power. How was she to know that there was another way to live? Besides, she often told her friends, however cruel Donald could be, she was very much in love with him. \nThis night Ivana had managed to wedge in the publisher of the local social paper, \u201cthe Shiny Sheet.\u201d As usual, Donald\u2019s weekend guests were paybacks, for he trusted few people. He had invited one of his construction executives, the mayor of West Palm Beach, and the former governor of New York, Hugh Carey, who in his days running the state as \u201cSociety Carey,\u201d boosted by huge Trump donations, had been crucial to Trump\u2019s early success. \nFor years, Ivana appeared to have studied the public behavior of the royals. Her friends now called this \u201cIvana\u2019s imperial-couple syndrome,\u201d and they teased her about it, for they knew that Ivana, like Donald, was inventing and reinventing herself all the time. When she had first come to New York, she wore elaborate helmet hairdos and bouffant satin dresses, very Hollywood; her image of rich American women probably came from the movies she had seen as a child. Ivana had now spent years passing through the fine rooms of New York, but she had never seemed to learn the real way of the truly rich, the art of understatement. Instead, she had become regal, filling her houses with the kind of ormolu found in palaces in Eastern Europe. She had taken to waving to friends with tiny hand motions, as if to conserve her energy. At her own charity receptions, she insisted that she and Donald form a receiving line, and she would stand in pinpoint heels, never sinking into the deep grass\u2014such was her control. \nThis spring night, a squad of servants had been outside to greet the guests, as if they had arrived at Cliveden between the wars. Most of the staff, however, were not a permanent part of Mar-a-Lago; they were local caterers and car parks, hired for the evening. In addition to the dining-room ceiling, Ivana had left Mrs. Post\u2019s shabby fringed sofas and Moroccan suites totally in place, giving the impression that she was trying on Mrs. Post\u2019s persona too. One of the few signs of the new owners\u2019 taste was the dozens of silver frames on the many end tables. The frames did not contain family pictures, but magazine covers. Each cover featured the face of Donald Trump. \nWhen the Trump plane landed in Palm Beach, two cars were usually waiting, the first a Rolls-Royce for the adults, the second a station wagon for the children, the nannies, and a bodyguard. Occasionally, state troopers were on hand to speed the Trump motorcade along. This took a certain amount of planning and coordination, but the effort was crucial for what Ivana was trying to achieve. \u201cIn fifty years Donald and I will be considered old money like the Vanderbilts,\u201d she once told the writer Dominick Dunne. \nThis past April, when his empire was in danger of collapse, Trump isolated himself in a small apartment on a lower floor of Trump Tower. He would lie on his bed, staring at the ceiling, talking into the night on the telephone. The Trumps had separated. Ivana remained upstairs in the family triplex with its beige onyx floors and low-ceilinged living room painted with murals in the style of Michelangelo. The murals had occasioned one of their frequent fights: Ivana wanted cherubs, Donald preferred warriors. The warriors won. \u201cIf this were on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, it would be very much in place in terms of quality,\u201d Trump once said of the work. That April, Ivana began to tell her friends that she was worried about Donald\u2019s state of mind. \nShe had been completely humiliated by Donald through his public association with Marla Maples. \u201cHow can you say you love us? You don\u2019t love us! You don\u2019t even love yourself. You just love your money,\u201d twelve-year-old Donald junior told his father, according to friends of Ivana\u2019s. \u201cWhat kind of son have I created?\u201d Trump\u2019s mother, Mary, is said to have asked Ivana. \nHowever unlikely it seemed, Ivana was now considered a tabloid heroine, and her popularity seemed in inverse proportion to the fickle city\u2019s new dislike of her husband. \u201cIvana is now a media goddess on par with Princess Di, Madonna, and Elizabeth Taylor,\u201d Liz Smith reported. Months earlier, Ivana had undergone cosmetic reconstruction with a California doctor. She emerged unrecognizable to her friends and perhaps her children, as fresh and innocent of face as Heidi of Edelweiss Farms. Although she had negotiated four separate marital-property agreements over the last fourteen years, she was suing her husband for half his assets. Trump was trying to be philosophical. \u201cWhen a man leaves a woman, especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of ass\u2014a good one!\u2014there are 50 percent of the population who will love the woman who was left,\u201d he told me. \nIvana had hired a public-relations man to help her in her new role. \u201cThis is all very calculated,\u201d one of her advisers told me. \u201cIvana is very shrewd. She\u2019s playing it to the hilt.\u201d \nMany floors beneath the Trumps, Japanese tourists roamed the Trump Tower lobby with their cameras. Inevitably, they took pictures of the display of Trump\u2019s familiar portrait from the cover of his book Trump: The Art of the Deal , which was propped on an easel outside the Trump Tower real-estate office. The Japanese still took Donald Trump to be the very image of power and money, and seemed to believe, as Trump once had, that this red-marble-and-brass monument was the center of the world. \nFor days, Trump rarely left his building. Hamburgers and French fries were sent up to him from the nearby New York Delicatessen. His body ballooned, his hair curled down his neck. \u201cYou remind me of Howard Hughes,\u201d a friend told him. \u201cThanks,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cI admire him.\u201d On the telephone he sounded ebullient, without a care, as confident as the image he projected in his lobby portrait. \nLike John Connally, the former governor of Texas, Trump had millions of dollars signed away in personal guarantees. The personal debt on the Trump Shuttle alone was $135 million. Bear Stearns had been guaranteed $56 million for Trump\u2019s Alexander\u2019s and American Airlines positions. The Taj Mahal casino had a complicated set of provisions which made Trump responsible for $35 million. Trump had personally guaranteed $125 million for the Plaza hotel. In West Palm Beach, Trump Plaza was so empty it was nicknamed \u201cthe Trump See-Through.\u201d That building alone carried $14 million worth of personal debt. Trump\u2019s mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach, as well as the yacht, had been promised to the banks for $40 million in outstanding loans. The Wall Street Journal estimated that Trump\u2019s guarantees could exceed $600 million. In one astonishing decade, Donald Trump had become the Brazil of Manhattan. \n\u2018Anybody who is anybody sits between the columns. The food is the worst, but you\u2019ll see everybody here,\u201d Donald Trump told me ten years ago at the \u201c21\u201d Club. Donald had already cut a swath in this preserve of the New York establishment; we were immediately seated between the columns in the old upstairs room, then decorated with black paneling and red Naugahyde banquettes. It was the autumn of 1980, a fine season in New York. The Yankees were in the pennant race; a movie star was running for president and using the term \u201cderegulation\u201d in his campaign. Donald was new then, thirty-four years old and very brash, just beginning to make copy and loving it. He was already fodder for the dailies and the weeklies, but he was desperate for national attention. \u201cDid you see that The New York Times said I looked like Robert Redford?\u201d he asked me. \nTrump hasn\u2019t changed much physically in the last ten years. Then, as now, he was all cheeks and jaw, with a tendency to look soft in the middle. He retains the blond hair, youthful swagger, and elastic face that give him the quality of the cartoon tough Baby Huey. Trump is a head swiveler, always looking around to see who else is in the room. As a boy, he was equally restless. \u201cDonald was the child who would throw the cake at the birthday parties,\u201d his brother Robert once told me. \u201cIf I built the bricks up, Donald would come along and glue them all together, and that would be the end of my bricks.\u201d \nHe was already married to Ivana, a former model and athlete from Czechoslovakia. One night in 1976, Trump had been at the bar in Maxwell\u2019s Plum. Maxwell\u2019s Plum is gone now, but the very name evokes the era of frantic singles underneath the Art Nouveau ceiling. It was the place where flight attendants hoped to find bankers, and models looked for dates. Donald met his model, Ivana Zelnickova, visiting from Montreal. She liked to tell the story of how she had gone skiing with Donald, pretending to be a learner like him, and then humiliated him by whizzing past him down the slopes. \nThey were married in New York during Easter of 1977. Mayor Beame attended the wedding at Marble Collegiate Church. Donald had already made his alliance with Roy Cohn, who would become his lawyer and mentor. Shortly before the wedding, Donald reportedly told Ivana, \u201cYou have to sign this agreement.\u201d \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust a document that will protect my family money.\u201d Cohn gallantly offered to find Ivana a lawyer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have these documents in Czechoslovakia,\u201d Ivana reportedly said, but she told friends that she was terrified of Cohn and his power over Donald. The first agreement gave Ivana $20,000 a year. Two years later, Trump had made his own fortune. \u201cYou better redo the agreement, Donald,\u201d Cohn reportedly told him. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re going to look hard and greedy.\u201d Ivana resisted. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, stick to the old agreement,\u201d Trump is said to have replied. \nDonald was determined to have a large family. \u201cI want five children, like in my own family, because with five, then I will know that one will be guaranteed to turn out like me,\u201d Donald told a close friend. He was willing to be generous with Ivana, and a story went around that he was giving her a cash bonus of $250,000 for each child. \nThe Trumps and their baby, Donald junior, lived in a Fifth Avenue apartment decorated with beige velvet sectional sofas and a bone-and-goatskin table from the Italian furniture store Casa Bella. They had a collection of Steuben glass animals which they displayed on glass shelves in the front hall. The shelves were outlined with a string of tiny white lights usually seen on a Christmas tree. \nDonald was trying to make time in the world of aesthetes and little black cocktail dresses. He had just completed the Grand Hyatt, on East Forty-second Street, and was considered a comer. He had put together the Fifth Avenue parcel that would become Trump Tower and had enraged the city establishment with his demolition of the cherished Art Deco friezes that had decorated the Bonwit Teller building. Even then, Trump\u2019s style was to turn on his audience. \n\u201cWhat do you think? Do you think blowing up the sculptures has hurt me?\u201d he asked me that day at \u201c21.\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cWho cares?\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s say that I had given that junk to the Met. They would have just put them in their basement. I\u2019ll never have the goodwill of the Establishment, the tastemakers of New York. Do you think, if I failed, these guys in New York would be unhappy? They would be thrilled! Because they have never tried anything on the scale that I am trying things in this city. I don\u2019t care about their goodwill.\u201d \nDonald was like an overgrown kid, all rough edges and inflated ego. He had brought the broad style of Brooklyn and Queens into Manhattan, flouting what he considered effete conventions, such as landmark preservation. His suits were badly cut, with wide cuffs on his trousers; he was a shade away from cigars. \u201cI don\u2019t put on any airs,\u201d he told me. He tooled around New York in a silver Cadillac with \u201cDJT\u201d plates and tinted windows and had a former city cop for his driver. \nDonald and I were not alone at lunch that day. He had invited Stanley Friedman to join us. Friedman was a partner of Roy Cohn\u2019s and, like Cohn, a legend in the city. He was part of the Bronx political machine, and would soon be appointed the Bronx County leader. Later, Friedman would go to jail for his role in the city parking-meter scandal. Trump and Friedman spent most of our lunch swapping stories about Roy Cohn. \u201cRoy could fix anyone in the city,\u201d Friedman told me. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a lousy lawyer, but he\u2019s a genius,\u201d Trump said. \nAt one point, Preston Robert Tisch, known to all as Bob, came into the upstairs room at \u201c21.\u201d Bob Tisch and his brother, Laurence, now the head of CBS, had made their fortune in New York and Florida real estate and hotels. Bob Tisch, like his brother, was a city booster, a man of goodwill and manners, a benefactor of hospitals and universities. \n\u201cI beat Bob Tisch on the convention-center site,\u201d Donald said loudly when Tisch stopped by our table. \u201cBut we\u2019re friends now, good friends, isn\u2019t that right, Bob? Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d \nBob Tisch\u2019s smile remained on his face, but there was a sudden strain in his tone, as if a child had misbehaved. \u201cOh yes, Donald,\u201d he said, \u201cgood friends. Very good friends.\u201d \nLate on summer Friday afternoons, the city of noise takes on an eerie quiet. In June I was with one of Donald Trump\u2019s more combative lawyers. \u201cWe certainly won\u2019t win in the popular press,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut we will win. You\u2019ll see.\u201d I thought of Trump a few blocks away, isolated in Trump Tower, fighting for his financial life. \nThe phone rang several times. \u201cYeah, yeah? Is that so?\u201d the lawyer said, and then laughed at the sheer\u2014as he phrased it\u2014\u201cbrass balls\u201d of his client, standing up to the numbers guys who were representing Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust, whom he was into for hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cDonald\u2019s very up. This is the kind of challenge Donald likes,\u201d the lawyer told me. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. You would never know anything is wrong.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t believe anything you read in the papers,\u201d Trump had told his publisher Joni Evans. \u201cWhen they hear the good news about me, what are they going to do?\u201d Random House was rushing to publish his new book, Trump: Surviving at the Top , with a first printing of 500,000. \nIn the Trump Tower conference room that week, one lawyer had reportedly told Trump the obvious: the Plaza hotel might never bring the $400 million he had paid for it. Trump stayed cool. \u201cGet me the Sultan of Brunei on the telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a personal guarantee that the Sultan of Brunei will take me out of the Plaza at an immense profit.\u201d \nThe bankers and lawyers in the conference room looked at Trump with a combination of awe and disbelief. Whatever their cynical instincts, Trump, the Music Man of real estate, could set off in them the power of imagination, for his real skill has always been his ability to convince others of his possibilities. The line between a con man and an entrepreneur is often fuzzy. \u201cThey say the Plaza is worth $400 million? Trump says it\u2019s worth $800 million. Who the hell knows what it is worth? I can tell you one thing: it is worth a lot more than I paid for it,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cWhen Forbes puts low values on all my properties, they say I am only worth $500 million! Well, that\u2019s $500 million more than I started with.\u201d \n\u2018Do people really think I am in trouble?\u201d Trump asked me recently. \n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cthey think you\u2019re finished.\u201d \nIt was an afternoon in July, when the dust seemed to be settling, and we were in the middle of a two-hour phone conversation. The conversation itself was a negotiation. Trump attempted to put me on the defensive. I had written about him ten years before. Trump had talked about a close friend of his who was the son of a famous New York real-estate developer. \u201cI told him to get out from under his father\u2019s thumb,\u201d Trump told me then. \u201cThat was off the record,\u201d Trump told me now. I looked up my old notes. \u201cWrong, Donald,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat was off the record was when you attacked your other friend and said he was an alcoholic.\u201d Without missing a beat, Trump said, \u201cI believe you.\u201d Then Trump laughed. \u201cSome things never change.\u201d \n\u201cJust wait five years,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cThis is really a no-brainer. Just like the Merv Griffin deal. When I took him to the cleaners, the press wanted me to lose. They said, \u2018Holy shit! Trump got taken!\u2019 Let me tell you something. It\u2019s good for me to be thought of as poor right now. You wouldn\u2019t believe some of the deals I am making! I guess I have a perverse personality. . . . I\u2019ve really enjoyed the last few weeks,\u201d he said, as if he had been rejuvenated at a spa. \nDeals had always been his only art. He was reportedly getting unbelievable deals now from the contractors he had hired to build his casinos and the fiberglass elephants that decorate the Boardwalk in front of the Taj Mahal, for they were desperate, unsure that they would ever get paid for months of work. Trump was famous for his skill at squeezing every last bit out of his transactions. He was known to be making shocking deals now that he never could have made two months before. \u201cTrump won\u2019t do a deal unless there\u2019s something extra\u2014a kind of moral larceny\u2014in it,\u201d one of his rivals once said of him. \u201cThings had gotten too easy for me,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI made a lot of money and I made it too easily, to the point of boredom. Anything I did worked! I took on Bally, I made $32 million. After a while it was too easy.\u201d \nThe fear of boredom has always loomed large in Trump\u2019s life. He has a short attention span. He even gave the appearance of having grown bored with his wife. He told me he had grown weary of his deals, his companies, \u201cNew York phonies,\u201d \u201cPalm Beach phonies,\u201d most social people, \u201cnegative\u201d writers, and \u201cnegatives\u201d in general. \u201cYou keep hitting and hitting and hitting, and after a while it doesn\u2019t mean as much to you,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cHey, when you first knew me, I basically had done nothing! So I had built a building or two, big deal.\u201d \nThat morning, Trump had been yet again on the front page of the New York Daily News , because Forbes had dropped him off the list of the world\u2019s richest men, placing his net worth at $500 million, down from $1.7 billion in 1989. \u201cThey put me on the front page for this bullshit reason!\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they put me on the cover of the Daily News , they sell more papers! They put me on the cover of the Daily News today with wars breaking out! You know why? Malcolm Forbes got thrown out of the Plaza by me! You know the story about me and Malcolm Forbes, when I kicked him out of the Plaza hotel? No? Well, I did. You\u2019ll read all about it in my new book. And I didn\u2019t throw him out because he didn\u2019t pay his bill. So I\u2019ve been expecting this attack from Forbes. The same writer who wrote about this also wrote that Merv kicked my ass! The same writer is under investigation. You heard about that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d (A Forbes writer is under investigation\u2014for alleged use of outdated police credentials. He did not write that Trump was taken by Merv Griffin.) \u201cWhat happened to me is what is happening in every company in America right now. There is not a company in America that isn\u2019t restructuring! Didn\u2019t you see The Wall Street Journal this morning about Revlon? What is going on at Revlon is what has happened to Donald Trump. But no one makes Revlon a front-page story. My problems didn\u2019t even merit a column in The Wall Street Journal. \u201d (Revlon was selling $182 million worth of stock to raise cash, but that was hardly the same as Trump\u2019s crisis.) \nTrump spoke in a hypnotic, unending torrent of words. Often he appeared to free-associate. He referred to himself in the third person: \u201cTrump says. . . Trump believes.\u201d His phrases skibbled around and doubled back on themselves like fireworks in a summer sky. He reminded me of a carnival barker trying to fill his tent. \u201cI\u2019m more popular now than I was two months ago. There are two publics as far as I\u2019m concerned. The real public and then there\u2019s the New York society horseshit. The real public has always liked Donald Trump. The real public feels that Donald Trump is going through Trump-bashing. When I go out now, forget about it. I\u2019m mobbed. It\u2019s bedlam,\u201d Trump told me. \nTrump is often belligerent, as if to pep things up. On the telephone with me, he attacked a local writer as \u201ca disgrace\u201d and savaged a financier\u2019s wife I knew as \u201ca giant, a three in the looks department.\u201d After the Resorts International deal, at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at the Aspen home of Barbara Walters and Merv Adelson, Trump was asked to make a wish for the coming year. \u201cI wish I had another Merv Griffin to bat around,\u201d he said. \nBefore the opening of the Taj Mahal, Marvin Roffman, a financial analyst from Philadelphia, correctly stated that the Taj was in for a rough ride. For that, Roffman believes, Trump had him fired. \u201cIs that why you attacked him?\u201d I asked Trump. \u201cI\u2019d do it again. Here\u2019s a guy that used to call me, begging me to buy stock through him, with the implication that if I\u2019d buy stock he\u2019d give me positive comments.\u201d \u201cAre you accusing him of fraud?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019m accusing him of being not very good at what he does.\u201d Congressman John Dingell of Michigan asked the S.E.C. to investigate the circumstances of Roffman\u2019s firing. When I asked Roffman about Trump\u2019s charges he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the most unbelievable garbage I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life.\u201d Roffman\u2019s attorney James Schwartzman called Trump\u2019s allegations \u201cthe desperate act of a desperate man.\u201d Roffman is now suing Trump for defamation of character. \n\u201cDonald is a believer in the big-lie theory,\u201d his lawyer had told me. \u201cIf you say something again and again, people will believe you.\u201d \n\u201cOne of my lawyers said that?\u201d Trump said when I asked him about it. \u201cI think if one of my lawyers said that, I\u2019d like to know who it is, because I\u2019d fire his ass. I\u2019d like to find out who the scumbag is!\u201d \nOne of Trump\u2019s first major deals in New York was to acquire a large tract of land on West Thirty-fourth Street being offered by the bankrupt Penn Central railroad. Trump submitted a plan for a convention center to city officials. \u201cHe told us he\u2019d forgo his $4.4 million fee if we would name the new convention center after his father,\u201d former deputy mayor Peter Solomon said. \u201cSomeone finally read the contract. He wasn\u2019t entitled to anywhere near the money he was claiming. It was unbelievable. He almost got us to name the convention center after his father in return for something he never really had to give away.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s first major real-estate coup in New York was the acquisition of the Commodore Hotel, which would become the Grand Hyatt. This deal, secured with a controversial tax abatement from the city, made Trump\u2019s reputation. His partner at the time was the well-respected Pritzker family of Chicago, who owned the Hyatt chain. Their contract was specific: Trump and Jay Pritzker agreed that if there were any sticking points they would have a ten-day period to arbitrate their differences. At one point, they had a minor disagreement. \u201cJay Pritzker was leaving for a trip to Nepal, where he was to be incommunicado,\u201d a lawyer for the Pritzker family told me. \u201cDonald waited until Jay was in the airplane before he called him. Naturally, Jay couldn\u2019t call him back. He was on a mountain in Nepal. Later, Donald kept saying, \u2018I tried to call you. I gave you the ten days. But you were in Nepal.\u2019 It was outrageous. Pritzker was his partner, not his enemy! This is how he acted on his first important deal.\u201d Trump later even reported the incident in his book. \n\u201cGive them the old Trump bullshit,\u201d he told the architect Der Scutt before a presentation of the Trump Tower design at a press conference in 1980. \u201cTell them it is going to be a million square feet, sixty-eight stories.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t lie, Donald,\u201d the architect replied. \nEventually Trump bought out the Equitable Life Assurance company\u2019s share of the commercial space in Trump Tower. \u201cHe paid Equitable $60 million after an arm\u2019s-length negotiation,\u201d a top real-estate developer told me. \u201cThe equity for the entire commercial space was $120 million. Suddenly, Donald was saying that it was worth $500 million!\u201d \nWhen The Art of the Deal was published, he told The Wall Street Journal that the first printing would be 200,000. It was 50,000 fewer than that. \nWhen Charles Feldman of CNN questioned Trump in March about the collapse of his business empire, Trump stormed off the set. Later, he told Feldman\u2019s boss, Ted Turner, \u201cYour reporter threatened my secretary and made her cry.\u201d \nWhen the stock market collapsed, he announced that he had gotten out in time and had lost nothing. In fact, he had taken a beating on his Alexander\u2019s and American Airlines stock. \u201cWhat I said was, other than my Alexander\u2019s and American Airlines stock, I was out of the market,\u201d Trump told me swiftly. \nWhat forces in Donald Trump\u2019s background could have set off in him such a need for self-promotion? \nTen years ago, I went to visit Trump\u2019s father in his offices on Avenue Z on the border of Coney Island in Brooklyn. Fred Trump\u2019s own real-estate fortune had been made with the help of the Brooklyn political machine and especially Abe Beame. In the 1940s, Trump and Beame shared a close friend and lawyer, a captain in a Brooklyn political club named Bunny Lindenbaum. At that time, Beame worked in the city budget office; thirty years later he would become mayor of the city. Trump, Lindenbaum, and Beame often saw one another at dinner dances and fund-raisers of the Brooklyn political clubs. It is impossible to overestimate the power of these clubs in the New York of the 1950s; they created Fred Trump and gave him access to his largest acquisition, the seventy-five-acre parcel of city land that would become the 3,800-unit Trump Village. \nIn 1960, an immense tract of land off Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn became available for development. The City Planning Commission had approved a generous tax abatement for a nonprofit foundation to build a housing cooperative. Fred Trump attacked this abatement as \u201ca giveaway.\u201d Soon after, Trump himself decided to go after the tax abatement. Although the City Planning Commission had already approved the nonprofit plan, Lindenbaum went to see Mayor Robert Wagner, and Beame, who was in Wagner\u2019s camp, supported Trump. \nFred Trump wound up with two-thirds of the property, and within a year he had broken ground on Trump Village. Lindenbaum was given the City Planning Commission seat formerly held by Robert Moses, the power broker who built many of New York\u2019s highways, airports, and parks. The following year, Lindenbaum organized a fund-raising lunch for Wagner, who was running for re-election. Forty-three builders and landlords pledged thousands of dollars; Trump, according to reporter Wayne Barrett, pledged $2,500, one of the largest contributions. The lunch party made the front page of the newspapers, and Lindenbaum, disgraced, was forced off the commission. But Robert Wagner won the election, and Beame became his comptroller. \nIn 1966, as Donald was entering his junior year at the Wharton business school, Fred Trump and Lindenbaum were investigated for their role in a $60 million Mitchell-Lama mortgage. \u201cIs there any way of preventing a man who does business in that way from getting another contract with the state?\u201d the investigations-commission chairman asked about Trump and Lindenbaum. Ultimately, Trump was forced to return $1.2 million that he had overestimated on the land\u2014part of which money he had used to buy a site nearby on which to build a shopping center. \nFred Trump\u2019s office was pleasantly modest; the rooms were divided by glass partitions. The Trump Organization, as Donald had already grandly taken to calling his father\u2019s company, was a small cottage on the grounds of Trump Village. At the time, Donald told reporters that \u201cthe Trump Organization\u201d had 22,000 units, although it had about half that number. Fred Trump was seventy-five then, polite, but nobody\u2019s fool. He criticized many of his son\u2019s early deals, warning him at one point that expanding into Manhattan was \u201ca ticket on the Titanic .\u201d Donald ignored him. \u201cA peacock today, a feather duster tomorrow,\u201d the developer Sam Lefrak is said to have remarked of Donald Trump. But ten years ago it was clear that Donald was the embodiment of his father\u2019s dreams. \u201cI always tell Donald, \u2018The elevator to success is out of order. Go one step at a time,\u2019 \u201d Fred Trump told me. \u201cBut what do you think of what my Donald has put together? It boggles the mind!\u201d \nDonald Trump has always viewed his father as a role model. In The Art of the Deal , he wrote, \u201cFred Trump was born in New Jersey in 1905. His father, who came here from Sweden . . . owned a moderately successful restaurant.\u201d In fact, the Trump family was German and desperately poor. \u201cAt one point my mother took in stitching to keep us going,\u201d Trump\u2019s father told me. \u201cFor a time, my father owned a restaurant in the Klondike, but he died when I was young.\u201d Donald\u2019s cousin John Walter once wrote out an elaborate family tree. \u201cWe shared the same grandfather,\u201d Walter told me, \u201cand he was German. So what?\u201d \nAlthough Fred Trump was born in New Jersey, family members say he felt compelled to hide his German background because most of his tenants were Jewish. \u201cAfter the war, he thought that Jews would never rent from him if they knew his lineage,\u201d Ivana reportedly said. Certainly, Fred Trump\u2019s camouflage could easily convey to a child the impression that in business anything goes. When I asked Donald Trump about this, he was evasive: \u201cActually, it was very difficult. My father was not German; my father\u2019s parents were German . . . Swedish, and really sort of all over Europe . . . and I was even thinking in the second edition of putting more emphasis on other places because I was getting so many letters from Sweden: Would I come over and speak to Parliament? Would I come meet with the president?\u201d \nDonald Trump appears to take aspects of his German background seriously. John Walter works for the Trump Organization, and when he visits Donald in his office, Ivana told a friend, he clicks his heels and says, \u201c Heil Hitler,\u201d possibly as a family joke. \nLast April, perhaps in a surge of Czech nationalism, Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler\u2019s collected speeches, My New Order , which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of My New Order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler\u2019s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist. \n\u201cDid your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?\u201d I asked Trump. \nTrump hesitated. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I said. \n\u201cActually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of Mein Kampf , and he\u2019s a Jew.\u201d (\u201cI did give him a book about Hitler,\u201d Marty Davis said. \u201cBut it was My New Order , Hitler\u2019s speeches, not Mein Kampf. I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I\u2019m not Jewish.\u201d) \nLater, Trump returned to this subject. \u201c If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.\u201d \nIs Ivana trying to convince her friends and lawyer that Trump is a crypto-Nazi? Trump is no reader or history buff. Perhaps his possession of Hitler\u2019s speeches merely indicates an interest in Hitler\u2019s genius at propaganda. The F\u00fchrer often described his defeats at Stalingrad and in North Africa as great victories. Trump continues to endow his diminishing world with significance as well. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that has the cash flow that I have,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal long after he knew better. \u201cI want to be king of cash.\u201d \nFred Trump, like his son, has never resisted exaggeration. When Donald was a child, his father bought a house that \u201chad nine bathrooms and columns like Tara,\u201d Fred Trump said. The house, however, was in Queens. Donald would someday envision a larger world. It was Donald\u2019s mother, Mary, who revered luxury. \u201cMy mother had a sense of the grand,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI can remember her watching the coronation of Queen Elizabeth and being so fascinated by it. My father had no interest in that kind of thing at all.\u201d \nDonald Trump often went with his father to construction sites, for they were extraordinarily close, almost kindred spirits. In family photographs, Fred and Donald stand together, often arm in arm, while Donald\u2019s sisters and younger brother, Robert, seem off in the ether. Ivana has told friends that Donald even persuaded his father to put him in charge of his three siblings\u2019 trust funds. \nDonald was one of five children, the second son. As a child, he was so boisterous that his parents sent him away to military school. \u201cThat was the way it worked in the Trump family,\u201d a longtime friend told me. \u201cIt was not a loving atmosphere.\u201d Donald was chubby then, but military school slimmed him down. He became forceful, and grew even closer to his father. \u201cI had to fight back all the time,\u201d Trump once told me. \u201cThese guys like my father are tough. You have to be hitting back! Otherwise they don\u2019t respect you!\u201d \nFamily members say that the firstborn son, Fred junior, often felt shut out by the relationship between Donald and his father. As a young man, he announced his intention to be an airplane pilot. Later, according to a friend of Ivana\u2019s, Donald and his father often belittled Fred junior for this career choice. \u201cDonald would say, \u2018What is the difference between what you do and driving a bus? Why aren\u2019t you in the family real-estate business?\u2019 \u201d Fred junior became an alcoholic and died at age forty-three. Ivana has always told her close friends that she believed the pressure put on him by his father and his brother hastened his early death. \u201cPerhaps unknowingly [we did put pressure on him],\u201d Trump told me. \u201cWe assumed that [real estate] came rather easy to us and it should have come easily to him. I had success, and that put pressure on Fred too. What is this, a psychoanalysis of Donald?\u201d \nDonald\u2019s relationship with Robert has also had troubled moments. Robert, who did go into the family business, has always been \u201cthe nice guy,\u201d in his brother\u2019s shadow. There has been additional friction between Robert\u2019s wife, Blaine, and Ivana. Blaine is considered a workhorse for New York charities, and Robert and Blaine are extremely popular\u2014\u201cthe good Trumps,\u201d they are called. \u201cRobert and I feel that if we say anything about the family, then we become public people,\u201d Blaine told me. The brothers\u2019 suppressed hostility erupted after the opening of the Taj Mahal. \u201cRobert told Donald that if he didn\u2019t give him autonomy he would leave,\u201d Ivana told a friend. \u201cSo Donald did leave him alone, and there was a mess with the slot machines which cost Donald $3 million to $10 million in the first three days. When Donald exploded, Robert packed his boxes and left. He and Blaine went to her family for Easter.\u201d \nAs his father had had Bunny Lindenbaum for his fixer, Donald Trump had Roy Cohn, the Picasso of the inside fix. \u201cCohn taught Donald which fork to use,\u201d a friend told me. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my lawyer Roy Cohn with me,\u201d Trump often told city officials a decade ago, before he learned better. \u201cDonald calls me fifteen to twenty times a day,\u201d Cohn once told me. \u201cHe has a maddening attention to detail. He is always asking, \u2018What is the status of this? What is the status of that?\u2019 \u201d \nIn a Trump tax-abatement case, according to Cohn\u2019s biographer Nicholas von Hoffman, the judge was handed a piece of paper that looked like an affidavit. It had just one sentence on it: \u201cNo further delays or adjournments. Stanley M. Friedman.\u201d By then Friedman had become the county leader of the Bronx. It wasn\u2019t necessary to exchange money for such favors. This was a classic \u201cmarker\u201d; the power of suggestion of future favors was enough. \nFriedman had also been crucial to Trump\u2019s plans for the Commodore Hotel. \u201cIn the final days of the Beame administration,\u201d according to Wayne Barrett, \u201cFriedman rushed a $160 million, forty-year tax abatement . . . and actually executed the documents for the lame duck Beame.\u201d Friedman had already agreed to join Cohn\u2019s law firm, which was representing Trump. \u201cTrump lost his moral compass when he made an alliance with Roy Cohn,\u201d Liz Smith once remarked. \nIn New York, Trump soon became known for his confrontational style. He also became the largest contributor to Governor Hugh Carey of New York, except for Carey\u2019s brother. Trump and his father gave $135,000. He was moving quickly now; he had set himself up in a Fifth Avenue office and a Fifth Avenue apartment and had hired Louise Sunshine, Carey\u2019s chief of fund-raising, as his \u201cdirector of special projects.\u201d \u201cI knew Donald better than anyone,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re a team, Sunshine and Trump, and when people shove us, we shove harder.\u201d Sunshine had raised millions of dollars for Carey, and she had one of the greatest address books in the city. She took Donald to meet every city and state power broker and worked on the sale of the Trump Tower apartments. \nReal-estate tax is immensely complicated. Often profit-and-loss accounting does not run parallel with cash flow. Sometimes a developer can have tremendous cash flow and yet not report taxable earnings; tax laws also permit developers to have less cash flow and greater taxable earnings. It is up to the developer. When Donald Trump broke ground on a new apartment building at Sixty-first Street and Third Avenue, Louise Sunshine was given a 5 percent share of the new Trump Plaza, as it was called. \nThere was some friction in Sunshine\u2019s relationship with her boss. As a result of Trump\u2019s accounting on Trump Plaza, Louise Sunshine, according to a close friend, would have had to pay taxes of $1 million. \u201cWhy are you structuring Trump Plaza this way?\u201d she reportedly asked Donald. \u201cWhere am I going to get $1 million?\u201d \u201cSell me back your 5 percent share of Trump Plaza and you can have it,\u201d Trump said. \nSunshine was so stunned by this that she went to her friend billionaire Leonard Stern for help. \u201cI wrote out a check for $1 million on the spot so that my close friend would not find herself squeezed out by Donald,\u201d Stern told me. \u201cI said to Louise, \u2018You tell Trump that unless he treats you fairly you will litigate! And as a result, the details of his duplicitous treatment would not only come to the attention of the public but also to the Casino Control Commission.\u2019 \u201d Louise Sunshine hired Arthur Liman, who would later represent the financier Michael Milken, to handle her case. Liman worked out a settlement: Trump paid Louise Sunshine $2.7 million for her share of Trump Plaza. Sunshine repaid Leonard Stern. For several years, Trump and Sunshine had a cool relationship. But in fine New York style, they are now friends again. \u201cDonald never should have used his money as a power tool over me,\u201d Sunshine told me, adding, \u201cI have absolved him.\u201d \nLike Michael Milken, Trump began to believe that his inordinate skills could be translated into any business. He started to expand out of the familiar world of real estate into casinos, airlines, and hotels. With Citicorp as his enabler, he bought the Plaza and the Eastern shuttle. He managed them both surprisingly well, but he had paid too much for them. He always had the ready cooperation of the starstruck banks, which would later panic. A member of the board of the Chase Manhattan Bank recently demanded at a meeting, \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name were you thinking of to make these loans?\u201d No satisfactory answer was forthcoming; the Rockefeller bank had once kept Brazil afloat, too. The bankers, like the Brooklyn-machine hacks from Trump\u2019s childhood, were blame shufflers, frantic to keep the game going. \n\u201cYou cannot believe the money the banks were throwing at us,\u201d a former top legal associate of Trump\u2019s told me. \u201cFor every deal we did, we would have six or eight banks who were willing to give us hundreds of millions of dollars. We used to have to pick through the financings; the banks could not sign on fast enough to anything Donald conceived.\u201d \n\u201cHe bought more and more properties and expanded so much that he guaranteed his own self-destruction. His fix was spending money. Well, his quick fix became his Achilles\u2019 heel,\u201d a prominent developer told me. \nTrump\u2019s negotiations, according to one lawyer who worked on the acquisition of the Atlantic City casino of Resorts International, were always unusually unpleasant. After the success of The Art of the Deal , Trump\u2019s lawyers began to talk about \u201cDonald\u2019s ego\u201d as if it were a separate entity. \u201cDonald\u2019s ego will never permit us to accept that point,\u201d one lawyer said over and over again during the negotiations. \u201cThe key to Donald, like with any bully, is to tell him to go fuck himself,\u201d the lawyer told me. When Mortimer Zuckerman, the chairman and C.E.O. of Boston Properties, submitted a design that was chosen for the site of the Fifty-ninth Street coliseum, Trump became apoplectic. \u201cHe called everyone, trying to get his deal killed. Of course, Mort\u2019s partner was Salomon Brothers, so Trump got nowhere,\u201d a person close to Zuckerman remembered. \nOne image of Ivana and Donald Trump sticks in my memory. Wintertime, three years ago. They were at the Wollman Rink. Donald had just fixed it up for the city. He had been crowing in the newspapers about what dummies Mayor Koch and the city had been, wasting years and money and coming up with nothing on the skating rink. Trump had taken over the job and done it well. If he grabbed more of the credit than he deserved, no one really held it against him; the rink was open at last and filled with happy skaters. \nIvana was wearing a striking lynx coat which showed her blond hair to advantage. Their arms were around each other. They looked so very young and rich, living in the moment of their success. A polite crowd had gathered to congratulate them on the triumph of the rink. The people near Donald appeared to feel enlivened by his presence, as if he were a hero. His happiness seemed a reflection of the crowd\u2019s adulation. \nNext to me a man called out, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you negotiate the SALT talks for Reagan, Donald?\u201d Ivana beamed. The snow began falling very lightly; from the rink below you could hear \u201cThe Skaters\u2019 Waltz.\u201d \nSome months before the Trumps\u2019 separation, Donald and Ivana were due at a dinner party being given in their honor. The Trumps were late, and this was not a dinner to be taken lightly. The hosts had a family name that evoked the very history of New York, yet as if they had recognized another force coming up in the city, they were honoring Donald and Ivana Trump. \nTrump entered the room first. \u201cI had to tape the Larry King show,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on Larry King tonight.\u201d He seemed very restless. Trump paid little attention to his blonde companion, and no one in the room recognized Ivana until she began to speak. \u201cMy God! What has she done to herself?\u201d one guest asked. Ivana\u2019s Slavic cheeks were gone; her lips had been fluffed up into a pout. Her limbs had been resculpted, and her cleavage astonishingly enhanced. The guests were so confused by her looks that her presence created an odd mood. \nAll through dinner Donald fidgeted. He looked at his watch. He mentioned repeatedly that he was at that moment on the Larry King show, as if he expected the guests to get up from their places. He had been belligerent to King that night, and he wanted the guests to see him, perhaps to confirm his powers. \u201cDo you mind if I sit back a little? Because your breath is very bad\u2014it really is,\u201d he had told Larry King on national TV. \n\u201cCome on, Arnold! Pose with me! Come on!\u201d Ivana Trump called out to the designer Arnold Scaasi on a warm night this past June. They were at the Waldorf-Astoria, at an awards ceremony sponsored by the Fragrance Foundation, and Ivana was a presenter. The carpet was shabby in the Jade Room; the paparazzi were waiting to pounce. P.R. materials covered the tables of this \u201cmust do\u201d event, of the kind that often passes for New York social life. The most expensive couture dress looked, under the blue-green tint of the lights, cheap. \nI was surprised that she appeared. The day before, her husband\u2019s crisis with the banks had provided the headlines on all three of the local tabloids. TRUMP IN A SLUMP! cried the Daily News. One columnist even said Trump\u2019s problems were the occasion for city joy, and proposed a unity day. \u201cIvana! Ivana! Ivana!\u201d the photographers called out to her. Ivana smiled, as if she were a presidential candidate. She wore a full-skirted mint-green satin beaded gown; her hair was swept off her face in a chignon. However humiliated for her children\u2019s sake she may have felt by the bad publicity, she had elected to leave them at home that night. Ivana was at the Waldorf by 6:15 P.M., greeting reporters and paparazzi by name. She could not afford now to alienate the perfume establishment by canceling, for soon she would be merchandising a fragrance, and she would need their goodwill. \nIvana seemed determined to keep her new stature in the city of alliances, for her financial future depended on her being able to salvage the brand name. As a woman alone, with a reduced fortune, Ivana was entering a tough world. She had no Rothkos to hock and no important jewels. But she did have the name Ivana, and she was making plans to market scarves, perfumes, handbags, and shoes, as once her husband had been able to market the name Trump. \nSeveral feet away from us, the local CBS reporter was doing a stand-up for the evening news. The reporter was commenting on the unraveling of the Trump empire while Ivana was chatting with Scaasi and Est\u00e9e Lauder. Lauder, a tough businesswoman herself, had reportedly told Ivana several months earlier, \u201cGo back with Donald. It is a cold world out here.\u201d I was reminded of a crowd scene in Nathanael West\u2019s Day of the Locust. Ivana even allowed the CBS reporter to shove a microphone into her face. \u201cDonald and I are partners in marriage and in business. I will stand beside him through thick or thin, for better or worse,\u201d she told the reporters with bizarre aplomb. Ivana had become, like Donald, a double agent, able to project innocence and utter confidence. She had, in fact, almost turned into Donald Trump. \n\u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019ve made Ivana a very popular woman. I\u2019ve made a lot of satellites. Hey, whether it\u2019s Marla or Ivana. Marla can do any movie she wants to now. Ivana can do whatever she wants,\u201d Donald Trump told me on the phone. \n\u201cNew York City is a very tough place,\u201d Ivana Trump told me years ago. \u201cI\u2019m tough, too. When people give me a punch in the nose, I react by getting even tougher.\u201d We were walking through the rubble of the Commodore Hotel, which would soon reopen as the Grand Hyatt. Ivana had been given the responsibility of supervising all the decoration; she was hard at it, despite the fact that she was wearing a white wool Thierry Mugler jumpsuit and pale Dior shoes as she picked her way through the sawdust. \u201cI told you never to leave a broom like this in a room!\u201d she screamed at one worker. Screaming at her employees had become part of her hallmark, perhaps her way of feeling power. Later, in Atlantic City, she would become known for her obsession with cleanliness. \nThe phrase \u201cStockholm syndrome\u201d is now used by Ivana\u2019s lawyer Michael Kennedy to describe her relationship with Donald. \u201cShe had the mentality of a captive,\u201d Kennedy told me. \u201cAfter a while she couldn\u2019t fight her captor anymore, and she began to identify with him. Ivana is deaf, dumb, and blind when it comes to Donald.\u201d If Donald worked eighteen-hour days, so would Ivana. The Trumps hired two nannies and a bodyguard for their children. She went to work running Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, often spending two or three days a week there supervising the staff. \nDetermined to bring glamour to Trump Castle, she became famous for her attention to appearances, once moving a pregnant waitress, desperate for big tips, off the casino floor. The woman was placed in a distant lounge and given a clown\u2019s suit to disguise her condition. \nIn New York, Ivana did not resist her husband\u2019s grandiosity. Soon after Trump Tower was completed, the Trumps took possession of their triplex. Ivana\u2019s lawyers often talk about her love of the domestic arts and describe her homemade jams and jellies. Yet the kitchen of her city apartment, which she designed, is tiny, no more than a kitchenette, tiled with gold linoleum. \u201cThe children\u2019s wing has a kitchen, and that is where the nanny cooks,\u201d a friend said. The Trump living room has a beige onyx floor with holes carved out to fit the carpets. There is a waterfall cascading down a marble wall, an Italianate fountain, and the famous murals. Their bedroom had a glass wall filled with arrangements of silk flowers. After a time, Ivana tired of the d\u00e9cor. She called in a renowned decorator. \u201cWhat can I do with this interior?\u201d she reportedly asked him. \u201cAbsolutely nothing,\u201d he said. \nChristmas Eve, three years ago. Ivana had received another stack of legal documents the size of a telephone book. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she is said to have asked Donald. \u201cIt is our new nuptial agreement. You get $10 million. Sign it!\u201d \u201cBut I can\u2019t look at this now, it\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Ivana said. Donald pressed her, according to Kennedy. Trump seemed extraordinarily concerned that she sign the papers, perhaps because an Atlantic City photographer was threatening to blackmail him with photos he had taken of him and Marla Maples. However efficiently Ivana ran Trump Castle, she seemed terrified of her husband. She signed the papers giving her $10 million and the mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. Later, Trump would tell reporters, \u201cIvana has $25 million.\u201d \nThe tactics he used in business he now brought home. \u201cDonald began calling Ivana and screaming all the time: \u2018You don\u2019t know what you are doing!\u2019 \u201d one of Ivana\u2019s top assistants told me. \u201cWhen Ivana would hang up the phone, I would say, \u2018How can you put up with this?\u2019 and Ivana would say, \u2018Because Donald is right.\u2019 \u201d He began belittling her: \u201cThat dress is terrible.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re showing too much cleavage.\u201d \u201cYou never spend enough time with the children.\u201d \u201cWho would touch those plastic breasts?\u201d Ivana told her friends that Donald had stopped sleeping with her. She blamed herself. \u201cI think it was Donald\u2019s master plan to get rid of Ivana in Atlantic City,\u201d one of her assistants told me. \u201cBy then, Marla Maples was in a suite at the Trump Regency. Atlantic City was to be their playground.\u201d \nIvana had once warned her husband against Atlantic City. \u201cWhy expand somewhere where there is no airport?\u201d Trump, however, was determined to invest there, even though Las Vegas associates had told him that Nevada gaming had profit factors that could total $200 million a year. But by now Marla Maples was in Atlantic City, and it was close to New York. Trump had become, according to one friend, \u201cso focused on Marla he wasn\u2019t paying attention to his business.\u201d \nThough Ivana had established herself in Atlantic City to please Donald, her presence there now, with Marla on the scene, was an inconvenience to him. With the acquisition of the Plaza hotel, he could deliver an ultimatum: \u201cEither you act like my wife and come back to New York and take care of your children or you run the casino in Atlantic City and we get divorced.\u201d \n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she asked one of her assistants. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do what he says, I am going to lose him.\u201d \nTrump even called a press conference to announce Ivana\u2019s new position as the president of the Plaza hotel: \u201cMy wife, Ivana, is a brilliant manager. I will pay her one dollar a year and all the dresses she can buy!\u201d Ivana called her friends in tears. \u201cHow can Donald humiliate me this way?\u201d \n\u201cI think Marla is very different from her image,\u201d Donald Trump told me in July. \u201cHer image is that of a very good-looking buxom blonde.\u201d A Donna Rice? \u201cShe\u2019s much different than that. She\u2019s smart, she\u2019s very nice, and not ambitious. She could have made a fortune in the last six months if she had wanted to!\u201d \n\u201cHow could you have allowed Marla to be the No Excuses jeans girl?\u201d I asked Trump. \u201cBecause I figured she could make $600,000 for doing one day\u2019s work. For the negative publicity, I thought, that $600,000 she can live on the rest of her life,\u201d Trump told me. \nThis past February, Trump took off for Japan, telling reporters he would be attending the Mike Tyson fight. His real motive was reportedly to meet with bankers to try to sell the Plaza, for Arthur Andersen\u2019s November audit had been dire. As he was flying back, he was radioed on the plane. Liz Smith had broken the story of the Trumps\u2019 separation. The entire sordid history of Marla Maples and Ivana fighting on the Aspen ski slopes was all over the papers. Ivana had done to Donald what years ago he had done to Jay Pritzker in Nepal. From the airplane, Trump called Liz Smith. \u201cCongratulations on your story,\u201d he told her sarcastically. \u201cI have had it with Ivana. She\u2019s gotten to be like Leona Helmsley.\u201d \u201cShame on you, Donald!\u201d Smith replied. \u201cHow dare you say that about the mother of your children?\u201d \u201cJust write that someone from Howard Rubenstein\u2019s office said it,\u201d Trump told Smith, referring to his well-connected press agent. (\u201cI never said that,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cYes, he did,\u201d said Smith.) The Japanese bankers with whom Trump had negotiated a tentative sale suddenly backed off. \u201cThe Japanese despise scandal,\u201d one of their associates told me. \nSeveral weeks later, Donald called Ivana. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk down Fifth Avenue together for the photographers and pretend that this entire scandal has been a publicity stunt? We could say that we wanted to see who would side with you and who would side with me.\u201d As the press became more sympathetic to Ivana, Donald would scream at his lawyers, \u201cThis is bullshit!\u201d \nIvana began to repair old feuds all over town. \u201cWe can be friends now, Leonard, can\u2019t we?\u201d she said at a recent party, according to a friend of Leonard Stern\u2019s. \u201cYour problem was with Donald, never me. I always liked you.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s lawyers tried mightily to catch up with Ivana. \u201cDonald saw a bill this week that Ivana charged $7,000 worth of Pratesi sheets for their daughter, Ivancka,\u201d one lawyer said. \u201cHe called in a rage. \u2018Why does a seven-year-old need $7,000 worth of sheets?\u2019 She charged a $350 shirt at Montenapoleone. Who was that for, her new best friend, Jerry Zipkin?\u201d The lawyer described Ivana\u2019s bills from Carolina Herrera: \u201cWe will get a bill for $25,000, and Ivana will have photocopied over the invoice, so instead of one dress at $25,000, in her own handwriting she will write, \u2018Six items for $25,000.\u2019 \u201d (A spokesman for Ivana says that this is completely untrue.) \nThe scandal was seriously affecting the Trump children. Donny junior was being ridiculed at the Buckley School. Ivancka had been in tears at Chapin. When Donald and Marla Maples attended the same Elton John concert, Donny junior cried, for his father had told the children he would give Marla Maples up. \u201cThe children are all wrecks,\u201d Ivana told Liz Smith. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Donald can say they are great and fine. Ivancka now comes home from school crying, \u2018Mommy, does it mean I\u2019m not going to be Ivancka Trump anymore?\u2019 Little Eric asks me, \u2018Is it true you are going away and not coming back?\u2019 \u201d However cavalier Ivana\u2019s public behavior was, in private she often cried. Once her husband\u2019s co-conspirator, she told friends that she now felt she was his victim. \nOn the Saturday of Donald Trump\u2019s forty-fourth-birthday celebration, I tried to take a walk on the West Side yards above Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The railroad tracks were rusty, the land was overgrown. The property stretched on, block after block. It was cool by the Hudson River that morning, with a pleasant breeze whipping over the water. The only sign of Trump was a high storm fence topped with elaborate curls of barbed wire to keep out the homeless people who live nearby. It was on this land, at the height of his megalomania, that Trump said he would erect \u201cthe tallest building in the world,\u201d a plan which was successfully thwarted by neighborhood activists who were resistant to having parts of the West Side obscured in shadow. \u201cThey have no power,\u201d Trump said at the time, baffled that anyone would resist his grandiose schemes. \nIvana had left for London to take part in one more public-relations event promoting the Plaza, only this time her friends the Baron and Baroness Ricky di Portanova were rumored to be paying the bill. Ivana had had her New York media campaign orchestrated by John Scanlon, who had handled public relations for CBS during the Westmoreland libel case. In London, she was cosseted by Eleanor Lambert, the doyenne of fashion publicists. A story went around London that she couldn\u2019t afford her hotel and had moved in with a friend on Eaton Square. She was treading the same ground as Undine Spragg, who so carefully calculated her rise in Edith Wharton\u2019s The Custom of the Country. Sir Humphry Wakefield assembled a list of titled guests for a dinner, but there was friction between him and Ivana. When the guests, including the Duchess of Northumberland, arrived, many of them were displeased that they had been lured to a dinner which, to their surprise, was in honor of Ivana Trump. \u201cHumphry will pay for this,\u201d one guest reportedly said. \nThat Saturday, New York seemed oddly vacant without the Trumps. Donald had left for his birthday party in Atlantic City. Hundreds of casino employees had been told to be on the Boardwalk to greet him, since Manhattan boosters were in short supply. The day before, he had defaulted on $73 million owed to bondholders and bankers. Clowns and jesters borrowed from Trump\u2019s Xanadu attempted to entertain the waiting employees and reporters underneath Trump\u2019s minarets and elephants, which soon might be repossessed. \nTrump arrived very late, flanked by his bodyguards. His face was hard, his mouth set into a line. With an elaborate flourish, Trump\u2019s executives pulled a curtain to reveal his birthday tribute, a huge portrait of Donald Trump, the same image the Japanese stared at in his Manhattan tower. The size of the portrait was unsettling on the Atlantic City Boardwalk: ten feet of the Donald, leaning forward on his elbow, his face frozen in the familiar defiant smirk. \nWithin days, the bankers agreed to give Trump $65 million to pay his bills. Much of his empire would probably have to be dismantled, but he would retain control. His personal allowance would now be $450,000 a month. \u201cI can live with that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHowever absurd this sounds, it was smarter to do it this way than to let a judge preside over a fire sale in a bankruptcy court,\u201d one banker told me. Trump crowed about the bailout. \u201cThis is a great victory. It\u2019s a great agreement for everybody,\u201d he said. \nNot exactly. Trump\u2019s bankers were said to be so upset at Trump\u2019s balance sheet\u2014 he was reportedly over half a billion dollars in the hole\u2014that they demanded he sign over his future trust inheritance to secure the new loans. Trump\u2019s father, who had created him by helping him achieve his first deals, now seemed to be rescuing him again. \u201cTotal bullshit,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI have been given five years by the banks. The banks would never have asked me for my future inheritance, and I would never have given it.\u201d \nSoon after, Trump announced that the French department store Galeries Lafayette would take over the vast space Bonwit Teller had vacated in Trump Tower. \u201cThis is in no way a comeback,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cBecause I never went anywhere.\u201d \nI was still searching for Donald Trump. On a rainy Thursday in July, I went down to federal court, where he was set to testify in a civil case in which he was a defendant. Along with his contractor, Trump had been accused of hiring scores of illegal Polish aliens to do the demolition work on the Trump Tower site. \u201cThe Polish brigade,\u201d as they came to be called, had been astonishingly exploited on the job, earning four dollars an hour for work that usually paid five times that. \nThe last time I had been in this neighborhood was to hear the verdict in the John Gotti trial. I had come to know the area well. The guard inside greeted me by name. I was often here dipping in and out of the courtrooms to observe the notorious figures of the last decade. I thought of Bess Myerson, Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Leona Helmsley, Imelda Marcos, and Adnan Khashoggi, shattered and brought down in the crazy kaleidoscope of the 1980s. Each one had, at one time in his or her life, been thought to be like Donald Trump, a figure of greatness, anointed with special powers. In front of the courthouse, the police barricades were up. So many celebrities passed through these revolving doors that the yellow saw-horses were left routinely on the massive courthouse steps. \nI thought about the ten years since I had first met Donald Trump. It is fashionable now to say that he was a symbol of the crassness of the 1980s, but Trump became more than a vulgarian. Like Michael Milken, Trump appeared to believe that his money gave him a freedom to set the rules. No one stopped him. His exaggerations and baloney were reported, and people laughed. His bankers showered him with money. City officials almost allowed him to set public policy by erecting his wall of concrete on the Hudson River. New York City, like the bankers from the Chase and Manny Hanny, allowed Trump to exist in a universe where all reality had vanished. \u201cI met with a couple of reporters,\u201d Trump told me on the telephone, \u201cand they totally saw what I was saying. They completely believed me. And then they went out and wrote vicious things about me, as I am sure you will, too.\u201d Long ago, Trump had counted me among his enemies in his world of \u201cpositives\u201d and \u201cnegatives.\u201d I felt that the next dozen people he spoke to would probably be subjected to a catalogue of my transgressions as imagined by Donald Trump. \nWhen I got to the courtroom, Trump had gone. His lawyer, the venerable and well-connected Milton Gould, was smiling broadly, for he appeared to believe that he was wiping the floor with this case. Trump had said that he knew nothing about the demolitions, that his contractor had been \u201ca disaster.\u201d Yet one F.B.I. informant testified that he had warned Trump of the presence of the Polish brigade and had told him that if he didn\u2019t get rid of them his casino license might not be granted. \nI wandered down to the pressroom on the fifth floor to hear about Trump\u2019s testimony. The reporters sounded weary; they had heard it all before. \u201cGoddamn it,\u201d one shouted at me, \u201cwe created him! We bought his bullshit! He was always a phony, and we filled our papers with him!\u201d \nI thought about the last questions Donald Trump had asked me the day before on the telephone. \u201cHow long is your article?\u201d \u201cLong,\u201d I said. Trump seemed pleased. \u201cIs it a cover?\u201d he asked. Share ",

During his time at the space station, Kelly has remained active on social media and often shares his unique perspective of the planet by posting photos. Because of his spectacularly encompassing vantage point, Gupta asked Kelly how he would define the Earth's condition if it were a human body. \"There are definitely parts of Asia, Central America that when you look at them from space, you're always looking through a haze of pollution,\" Kelly said. \"As far as the atmosphere is concerned, and being able to see the surface, you know, I would say definitely those areas that I mentioned look kind of sick.\" He said he notices weather systems, such as tropical cyclones, in unexpected locations. \"When you look at the ... atmosphere on the limb of the Earth, I wouldn't say it looks unhealthy, but it definitely looks very, very fragile and just kind of like this thin film, so it looks like something that we definitely need to take care of.\" Read More Kelly is currently in his 501st day in space over six different missions and the 321st day of his one-year mission aboard the International Space Station.

Good night from @space_station!\" Hide Caption 15 of 15 Part of his current mission includes conducting a twin health study comparing the mental and physical toll on Kelly's body in space with his twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, who is on Earth. The medical tests are measuring the impact of zero gravity on bone density, vision, the microbiome, blood, heart and cells, as well as the psychological impact on mood, stress and cognitive functions. Kelly said he is doing well, although he feels like he's been up in space for a really long time and looks forward to getting home soon. Space: Where Russia and America still get along \"I don't really have any surprises,\" Kelly said. \"A lot of the research we do is imagery based. Just this morning, I was doing some ultrasound exams on my eyes, on my heart and a lot of that data is stuff that will be analyzed by scientists and researchers and it will take time well after I'm back before we have results. But from a kind of a subjective perspective, I kind of knew what to expect going into this because I've flown a long-duration flight before, so you know there's been little effects on my vision which I had last time. But overall, nothing alarming.\" The NASA diet: It's food, but not as we know it Kelly will splash down March 1, along with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, who has spent the year with him on the ISS after launching on March 27, 2015 . Kelly also talked about the passage of time on the ISS, how feasible a trip to Mars could be, his views on private space travel and even what he would ask the candidates during a debate. The following interview has been edited for clarity. Gupta: One of the objectives for this mission, besides the twin study, was to look at how feasible a mission to Mars might be. If this were a mission to Mars, which takes nine months or longer, you'd in fact, just be getting started with that mission as opposed to getting near to the end. I'm curious, with all that you learned, that you've seen, do you think Mars is feasible and also, when we eventually maybe get there, do you think there's extraterrestrial life there or other places? Kelly: Yeah, I think it's definitely feasible. I think there are certain challenges -- you know, the radiation environment between the Earth and Mars is something that we're going to have to figure out, because we get protection here on the space station although we get a lot more radiation than you do on Earth. You get much much more on your way to Mars, so that's a challenge. The systems, the life support systems, are on one hand a challenge, but we have been maintaining these systems here for the last 15 years now. We can get resupply quicker, but a lot we have learned here from operating a space station will help us go to Mars. I think the biggest challenge, though, is the public support and the financial support from our government or other governments to do this, because I think, technically, pretty much anything we have ever put our mind to we have been able to accomplish. So I think the challenge is mostly from public and government financial support. As far as whether there is life there on Mars or whether there was actually ever life there, I don't know. It would be great to find out, though. Gupta: Gravitational waves have been found, proving yet another one of Einstein's theories correct. Another one of his theories that has to do with the space-time continuum, which would dictate that you're aging more slowly than your twin brother, Mark, [who is] here is on Earth. Obviously, it's a miniscule difference, but I'm curious, does it feel different time-wise? Does time change for you in some way, being up there? Kelly: We are in this environment that is like a laboratory in many ways -- in some ways, it is kind of like a submarine or a ship -- but one in which you cannot leave and one in which you know: I'm at work when I go to sleep, I'm at work when I wake up. I've been here since March [2015]. It's not like the days seem to go by slower, but definitely the whole period of time seems like a long time. A year now seems longer than I thought it would be and so I definitely have an appreciation for certain things that freedom and being on Earth provide. It's different when you're in space, but I definitely think I would kind of relish my freedom more after this experience than maybe I did before. Gupta: I'm curious about your views on private space travel. There's been a lot of energy and money, frankly, around that industry lately. As someone who's done it, been up there, what do you think? Do you support it? Do you encourage it? Kelly: Absolutely. This is an amazing experience. This is an incredibly complex facility and by doing really hard things, we reap the benefits and commercial space [travel] is hard. So, by developing those rockets and systems to have more people visit and live in space for periods of time, there will be benefits to that. ... It is something that I definitely feel strongly about. It's great that we have these companies that are pursuing this, because then it lets NASA direct their energy and focus on the frontier, the places we haven't been to before. I think those are the kinds of things the government should be involved with and I think something NASA does very well. Gupta: What would you ask our future president or presidential candidates? We have a series of debates coming up here on CNN and I want to give you the floor for a second here, commander, to ask a question of our next president. Kelly: You know, I guess, as an astronaut, as a NASA astronaut, I would ... feel obligated to ask a space-related question and what their goals and their vision are for our space program. I think our history in space and the International Space Station and those other things we do have significant value to our economy, to who we are as a people, as a species, really. I would want to know [what] their vision is for NASA and how they would plan to execute that vision.

      "text": "ISIS claims credit for Brussels attacks, as death toll reaches 31 Published March 22, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nISIS claimed credit for Tuesday morning\u2019s rush-hour attacks in Brussels, which left at least 31 dead and more than 180 injured, and authorities in Belgium released a chilling surveillance photo that may show three of the bombers moments before explosions ripped through the European capital\u2019s biggest airport. \nThe bombings, including at least two at Zaventum airport and another at a Metro Station near European Union headquarters, came four days after the arrest of Salah Abdeslam, the main remaining suspect from November\u2019s attack in Paris, and sent Brussels into full lockdown mode. Hours later, a channel on the encrypted messaging app Telegram that is maintained by ISIS described the operation. \n\u201cIslamic State fighters carried out a series of bombings with explosive belts and devices on Tuesday, targeting an airport and a central metro station in the center of the Belgian capital Brussels, a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State,\u201d the message read. Related Image Expand / Contract Belgian officials released a CCTV image Tuesday showing three men believed to be involved in the Brussels terror attack at the Zaventem Airport. (Belgian law enforcement authorities) \n\u201cIslamic State fighters opened fire inside Zaventem Airport, before several of them detonated their explosive belts, as a martyrdom bomber detonated his explosive belt in the Maalbeek metro station. The attacks resulted in more than 230 dead and wounded.\" \nThe attack at the airport killed at least 15 and left as many as 81 wounded. It was followed by a bombing moments later in a train station that killed at least 20. \n\u201cIslamic State fighters carried out a series of bombings with explosive belts and devices on Tuesday, targeting an airport and a central metro station in the center of the Belgian capital Brussels, a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.\u201d \n- Message from ISIS claiming credit for attacks \nBelgian authorities released a photo that showed three gloved men pushing carts in the airport, prior to reaching security checkpoints. In the image, two men on the left are wearing dark clothing and each sport a black glove on their left hand, which authorities believe could have been worn to hide suicide vest ignition devices. \nAt least one suicide vest was used during the airport attack, officials have said, and there were reports that authorities detonated an unexploded vest after the attack. The man on the right is wearing lighter clothing, no glove and a hat. Police may be hunting the man in the hat, according to The Telegraph. Related Image Expand / Contract This image was released on an ISIS-linked Telegram account shortly after the attacks in Brussels. \nWitnesses said the airport attack, which occurred just after 8 a.m., was accompanied by shouts in Arabic and gunfire, and an unexploded suicide belt was reportedly found in the aftermath. Sources also said it was possible one or more of the explosions emanated from suitcase bombs packed with nails. \nThe claim of responsibility could not be corroborated by authorities, but ISIS has been known to use Telegram for its communications for most of the last year. Telegram is a digital messaging system invented by two Russian brothers now based in Berlin who boast their system encrypts content for storage and transmission. Unlike Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, Telegram does not suspend private accounts or cooperate with government intelligence agencies. \nAlso posted on the ISIS-linked site immediately after the bombing attacks was an image showing a city or a possible composite of several cities with a message warning \u201cWe are already in your city.\u201d \n\u201cThis image is from a new Telegram social media channel posted today after the attack,\u201d said Veryan Khan, editorial director for the U.S.-based Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium. \u201cThere is no caption, but the graphic appears to be a mixture of different cities, including the river in London\u2019s Thames and the rest of the visuals appear to be other cities.\u201d \nThere is reason to be skeptical of the claim, said Ryan Mauro, national security analyst for the Clarion Project and professor of homeland security at Liberty University. He said messages and hashtags can be written very quickly after an attack. \n\u201cIt is so obvious that this is ISIS-related that ISIS accounts who knew nothing about the forthcoming attacks don't risk their credibility very much by claiming credit,\u201d Mauro said. \nMeanwhile, Belgium in particular and Europe in general were reeling following the attack. \n\"What we feared has happened, we were hit by blind attacks,\" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. \n\"We are at war,\u201d French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Tuesday. \u201cWe have been subjected for the last few months in Europe to acts of war.\" \nThe first two explosions rocked the departure hall at the Brussels airport shortly after 8 a.m. local time. Early reports placed the number of dead at 13, with as many as 81 wounded, although the death toll was later revised downward to 11. \nWitnesses recounted a harrowing and chaotic scene. \n\u201cFirst there was one explosion. Everyone started to run and panic broke out. Then a second explosion was heard,\u201d one witness told The Brussels Times about the airport explosion. \nZach Mouzoun, who arrived on a flight from Geneva about 10 minutes before the first blast, told BFM television that the second, louder explosion brought down ceilings and ruptured pipes, mixing water with blood from victims. \n\"It was atrocious. The ceilings collapsed,\" he said. \"There was blood everywhere, injured people, bags everywhere.\" \n\"We were walking in the debris. It was a war scene,\" he said. \nMarie-Odile Lognard, a traveler who was lining up in the departures hall for a flight to Abu Dhabi, told BFM television that people panicked after the first explosion about 65 feet from her and that a second explosion about 15 seconds later caused parts of the ceiling to collapse. \n\"I knew it was an explosion because I've been around explosions before,\" said Denise Brandt, an American woman interviewed by Sky television. \n\"I felt the explosion, the way it feels through your body. And we just looked at each other and I said 'let's go this way.' It was over there. There was just this instinct to get away from it. Then we saw people running, crying, toward us. So I knew we were going in the right direction and away from it. \" \nAmateur video shown on France's i-Tele television showed passengers -- including a child -- running with a backpack dashing out of the terminal in different directions as they tugged luggage. Belgian news channel RTBF reports a Kalashnikov rifle was found in the departure hall at the airport. \nMarc Noel, 63, was about to board a Delta flight to Atlanta, to return to his home in Raleigh, N.C. \nA Belgium native, Noel says he was in an airport shop buying automobile magazines when the first explosion occurred about 50 yards away. \n\"People were crying, shouting, children. It was a horrible experience,\" he told AP. He said his decision to buy the magazines might have saved his life. \"I don't want to think about it, but I would probably have been in that place when the bomb went off.\" \nThree Mormon missionaires, identified by the church as Richard Norby, 66; Joseph Empey, 20, and Mason Wells, 19, all of Utah, were the only Americans known to have been injured in the airport attack. \nMoments later at the Metro station, another explosion was reported on a train that was stopped at the Maelbeek subway station, not far from the headquarters of the European Union. Ian McCafferty told The Irish Times he was just getting off the metro at the stop before Maelbeek around 8:20 a.m. when he heard a \u201cloud muffled thud\u201d but, because of construction at the metro, he \u201cdidn\u2019t really think much of it. \n\u201cThere was a large military presence and mass confusion,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople started to run. Some people were crying. The two stations are only a stone\u2019s throw apart. We were the last train through the station before the blast.\u201d \nRescue workers set up a makeshift treatment center in a local pub near the train station. Dazed and shocked morning travelers streamed from the metro entrances as police tried to set up a security cordon. \nBrussels Mayor Yvan Majeur put the number of dead at the train station at 20, with more than 100 more injured. \nAlexandre Brans, 32, who was wiping blood from his face, said: \"The metro was leaving Maelbeek station when there was a really loud explosion. It was panic everywhere. There were a lot of people in the metro.\" \nFirst responders ran through the street outside with two people on stretchers, their clothes badly torn. \nThe bombings in the European Union capital are certain to add new fire to the raging debate over refugees from Muslim nations where terrorist groups are active. Europe has taken in more than a million refugees, and terror groups including ISIS have said they are infiltrating the wave of migrants. \nAfter his arrest on Friday, Abdeslam, who is suspected of taking part in the Nov. 13 Paris attack that killed 130 people, told authorities he had created a new network and was planning new attacks. \nAfter Abdeslam's arrest and before Tuesday's attacks, authorities were frantically hunting a suspect identified as 24-year-old Najim Laachraoui, who allegedly traveled to Hungary with Abdeslam before the Paris attack on Nov. 13. It was unclear whether Laachraoui played any role in Tuesday's bombings, but prosecutors say Laachraoui played a key role in recruiting attackers for ISIS. \nU.S. authorities were monitoring the situation, poised to assist in the investigation. A U.S. counter-terrorism source told Fox News the priority for investigators is identifying the suicide bomber or bombers through DNA because they cannot operate in isolation, and identifying them can lead to the broader network. \nSpeaking Havana, President Obama mentioned the attacks before giving prepared comments on the thawing relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. Obama called the attacks \u201coutrageous,\u201d and pledged that the thoughts and prayers of Americans are with the Belgian people. \n\u201cThis is yet another reminder that the world must unite, we must be together, regardless of nationality or race or faith, in fighting the scourge of terrorism,\u201d said Obama, who had also spoken to Michel by phone. \nBelgium's interior minister announced that the terror threat was being raised to its maximum level. All flights were canceled and arriving planes and trains were diverted. \nAuthorities told people in Brussels to stay where they were, bringing the city to a standstill. Airport security was also tightened in Paris, London and other European cities. Flights due to land at Zaventem, which handles 21 million passengers a year, were sent to Antwerp, Liege, and Brussels Charleroi airports. \nFrench President Francois Hollande said \"terrorists struck Brussels but it was Europe that was targeted -- and all the world that is concerned,\" adding that \"this war will be long.\" \nParis announced it would light the Eiffel Tower in the colors of the Belgian flag, and security around France's nuclear plants was reportedly increased, though no specific threat was cited. \nFox News' Malia Zimmerman, Catherine Herridge and Matthew Dean contributed to this report.

      "text": "Global \n\u201cIt is perfectly true, as the philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition: that it must be lived forwards.\u201d This observation was made in 1843 by the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard in a journal entry, but it might have been written about the contemporary Middle East. \nWe have been living the Islamic State forwards, surprised at every turn, but we can perhaps begin to understand it backwards. Although ISIS took most of the world by surprise when it swept into the Iraqi city of Mosul in June 2014, the group and its forebears had been proclaiming their goals for a decade. Like many consequential events, this one didn\u2019t sneak up on policymakers; they simply didn\u2019t see what was taking shape in front of them. ISIS told us exactly what it was going to do, and then did it. This was a secret conspiracy hiding in plain sight. Exploring the hard choices facing the United States and the world Read More \nISIS is mysterious in part because it is so many things at once. It combines Islamic piety and reverence for the prophet and his companions with the most modern social-media platforms and encryption schemes; its videos blend the raw pornographic violence of a snuff film with the pious chanting of religious warriors; the group has the discipline of a prison gang (many of its recruits were indeed drawn from U.S.-organized prisons in Iraq), but also the tactical subtlety and capacity for deception of the most skilled members of Saddam Hussein\u2019s intelligence services, who were also pulled into the ISIS net. It appears less brittle than al-Qaeda because its members care less about religious doctrine and organizational hierarchy. As has been said of the Episcopal Church (forgive the comparison), ISIS is solid at the core but loose at the edges. \nWhat is ravaging the Middle East right now is obviously deeper than ISIS. It has become commonplace over the last year to observe that we are witnessing the collapse of the post-Ottoman order\u2014that the \u201clines in the sand\u201d conjured in 1916 by the British and French diplomats Mark Sykes and Fran\u00e7ois Georges-Picot are being blown to dust. But we haven\u2019t reckoned with how the insurgents perceive that process. ISIS has religious, psychological, and technological faces. But in some fundamental respects it is an anti-colonial movement that takes as its reference point Islam\u2019s pre-colonial conception of power\u2014an Islamic state, a Sunni caliphate. Even if ISIS is crushed, this idea of \u201cour caliphate\u201d is likely to persist, and return. Related Story \nThe Syrian Civil War: What? \nThe story of ISIS teaches the same basic lesson that emerged from America\u2019s other failures in the Middle East over the last decade: Attempts by the United States or Islamist rebels to topple authoritarian regimes\u2014in Iraq, Libya, and now Syria\u2014create power vacuums. This empty political space will be filled by extremists unless the United States and its allies build strong local forces that can suppress terrorist groups and warlords both. When the U.S. creates such local forces, it must be persistent. If it withdraws from these efforts, as America did in Iraq in 2011, it invites mayhem. Halfway American intervention has produced nothing but trouble. Rebels have gotten enough support to continue fighting, but not enough to win. \nHistory teaches that such wars end through a combination of the exhaustion of local combatants and an agreement among major regional and international powers on a formula to curtail the fighting and rebuild some governance. Usually the settlement ratifies the informal cantonal boundaries that have emerged during the fighting, so that each sect has what amounts to a \u201csafe zone\u201d in a decentralized state that functions under the umbrella of the old nation. That\u2019s what happened in Lebanon with the Taif Agreement in 1989, and it\u2019s probably the best that can be hoped for in Iraq and Syria. To reduce human suffering on the way to such a new equilibrium, it\u2019s important, where possible, to back moderate forces as they create the safe zones that will eventually form the pieces of the new federal state\u2014and that provide platforms for attacking extremist groups. Middle Eastern wars rarely end with outright victory and permanent stability, so the word \u201csettlement\u201d may promise too much. At best, for many years, it may simply mean stable ceasefire lines, reduced bloodshed, fewer refugees, and less terrorism. \nUltimately, the errors of judgment that led to ISIS\u2019s rise have been too consequential for any easy prescriptive advice. Instead, I share a comment made to me in June 2003, as this terrible story was beginning, by a Syrian businessman named Raja Sidawi. Here\u2019s a passage from the Washington Post column that quoted my friend\u2019s warning: \n\u201cI am sorry for America,\u201d Sidawi said. \u201cYou are stuck. You have become a country of the Middle East. America will never change Iraq, but Iraq will change America.\u201d \u2026 \nThis tragic sensibility\u2014the sense that in most instances, things do not work out as you might have hoped\u2014is generally lacking in the American character. Americans are an optimistic people: They have difficulty imagining the worst. That was why 9/11 was so shocking. Most Americans never considered that such devastation could be visited on them. \nArabs grow up in a culture where it is always best to assume the worst. Sidawi rattled off the list of wars and disasters that have afflicted the Middle East almost continuously since he was born in 1939. That is the bloody history in which America has now enmeshed itself. \n\u201cYou will learn the culture of death,\u201d warned Sidawi. \nAnd so we have. The Iraqi Roots of ISIS \nThe Koranic message of submission and jihad is perhaps as powerful now for believers as it was in 622 A.D., when the Prophet Muhammad gathered his followers in Medina and began raiding neighboring areas. The historian Robert G. Hoyland described this ideological spark in his book In God\u2019s Path: The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire . It\u2019s the same idea that is evoked in the nasheeds , or Islamic chants, that provide the soundtrack for many ISIS videos today: \u201cWhat is most striking is the very simple but powerful program of action outlined by Muhammad: form a righteous community (umma) , go to a safe place (hijra) , and from there embark on jihad against the unrighteous,\u201d noted Hoyland. \nBut religion alone cannot explain the growth of the first caliphate in the seventhcentury, any more than it can the rapid expansion of the current, self-proclaimed successor caliphate. The spark of jihad ignited and spread so quickly after Muhammad\u2019s death in 632 in part because it fell on the dry tinder of a region enfeebled by imperial wars that had exhausted the Byzantine and Persian Empires. \u201cYou are stuck. You have become a country of the Middle East. America will never change Iraq, but Iraq will change America.\u201d \n\u201cThe change was so sudden and unexpected that it needs explanation,\u201d wrote Albert Hourani in his landmark study, A History of the Arab Peoples . He noted archeological evidence indicating that the prosperity of the eastern Mediterranean had been undermined by invasions and the loss of agricultural techniques such as terraced farming. It was a region ripe for plunder. \u201cThe Arabs who invaded the two empires were not a tribal horde but an organized force, some of whose members had acquired military skill and experience in the service of the empires or in the fighting after the death of the Prophet,\u201d he wrote. (Reading Hourani\u2019s words, I couldn\u2019t help but think of the unlikely contemporary alliance between ISIS religious zealots and ex-Baathists who served in Saddam Hussein\u2019s most secret and brutal units.) \nThe story of how the forebears of ISIS got started in Iraq is largely the story of a rough-hewn, charismatic al-Qaeda recruit named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Back in 2003, observed an anonymous former Western official recently in The New York Review of Books , who \u201ccould have imagined that a movement founded by a man [who once worked in] a video store in provincial Jordan would tear off a third of the territory of Syria and Iraq, shatter all these historical institutions and\u2014defeating the combined armies of a dozen of the wealthiest countries on earth\u2014create a mini-empire?\u201d \nZarqawi made his name challenging the grandees of al-Qaeda: the wealthy Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden and the Egyptian doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri. Whereas al-Qaeda\u2019s core leadership planned meticulous, top-down operations, Zarqawi strove instead to emulate the romantic, Crusader-conquering Nur al-Din Zengi, who drove Westerners from Syria. \nConvinced the Americans would invade Iraq, Zarqawi began building a base there in 2002; when they did so a year later, he proved willing to ally with remnants of Saddam\u2019s intelligence network. The story is well told by William McCants in his excellent new book, The ISIS Apocalypse. Four months after the U.S. invasion, Zarqawi\u2019s organization attacked three well-chosen targets\u2014UN headquarters in Baghdad, the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad, and the Imam Ali Mosque, a Shiite shrine, in Najaf\u2014that signaled the dirty war ahead. These bombs shattered the ground for reconciliation: Iraq would be a no-go zone for the international organizations that might have lightened the burden of U.S. occupation; Iraq\u2019s links would be severed with its mainstream Sunni patron, Jordan; and Iraq would be cleaved apart by a vicious sectarian war between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, whose coexistence had been a feature of modern Iraqi life. Zarqawi\u2019s game plan was set by late August 2003; at the time, the United States was still denying there was an insurgency in the country. A U.S. marine passes Iraqis sitting outside their house during a patrol in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2005. (Anja Niedringhaus / AP) \nMy recollection of Iraq in late 2003 was of growing violence from Zarqawi\u2019s Sunni insurgency, yes. But even more, I was struck by the desperation of Iraq\u2019s Sunni sheikhs, who feared and in many cases despised the brutal Zarqawi, but couldn\u2019t get tone-deaf U.S. officials in the international Green Zone to take their problems seriously. \nTake Fallujah, a sprawling city just west of Baghdad and one of Zarqawi\u2019s early recruiting grounds. Fallujah\u2019s Sunni male residents all seemed to have served in the army or worked as smugglers (or both), and the tribal elders there wanted the United States to provide protection from Zarqawi and a deal that would give the Sunnis a share of the post-invasion spoils. But their pleas were largely ignored. When I visited Sheikh Khamis al-Hassnawi at his villa near the Euphrates River in September 2003, he spoke not only of procuring an American wife (he seemed to have formed his impressions of the U.S. from Baywatch ), but also of the dire need for American aid and an ongoing American military presence in the country. \u201cIf coalition forces withdraw now, the strong will eat the weak, and people will start killing each other in the street,\u201d he said . \nThat proved an accurate forecast of what occurred from 2004 on, before U.S. forces embraced a \u201cclear and hold\u201d counterinsurgency policy for Iraq. For the social engineers in the Green Zone, the downtrodden Kurds and Shiites were the instruments for change in the New Iraq. If the Sunnis wouldn\u2019t go along, too bad for them. In this period of growing insurgency and civil war, I remember one prominent U.S. National Security Council official telling me more than once that the answer for Iraq was the \u201c80-percent solution\u201d\u2014in other words, Kurds and Shiites would build the new state regardless of opposition from the 20 percent of the population that was Sunni. This view was recklessness dressed up as realpolitik. \nAs Zarqawi\u2019s toxic violence escalated, especially toward Shiites, bin Laden and his top deputies became concerned. Zawahiri warned Zarqawi to stop showing beheadings in the videos he posted online. McCants quotes Zawahiri\u2019s admonition that these ultra-violent images might excite \u201czealous young men\u201d but would appall ordinary Muslims. \u201cWe are in a media battle in a race for the hearts and minds of our community,\u201d Zawahiri warned. The message was, in effect: Don\u2019t burn too hot; you\u2019ll burn yourself out. By 2009, the movement Zarqawi created was all but dead. But not quite. Embers of his Islamic state remained, kept alive by Sunni rage. \nThe hotheads in Iraq didn\u2019t listen, especially when it came to their pet project of declaring an Islamic state in Iraq. Zarqawi\u2019s first discussions of creating a caliphate date back to 2004, according to McCants. Al-Qaeda\u2019s supreme command disagreed; bin Laden felt that moving too soon for power in Iraq and Yemen, the movement\u2019s two strongholds, would lead to premature defeat and tarnish the brand. \nU.S. airstrikes killed Zarqawi in June 2006, but his renegade followers nevertheless went on to declare their state, the Islamic State of Iraq, in October 2006, without consulting al-Qaeda leaders. Simultaneously, the sectarian war Zarqawi had launched against the Shiites was proving all too successful. Fifty or more bodies were found every morning in Baghdad; it was said that the Sunnis usually beheaded their victims, while the Shiites drilled holes in their heads. The U.S. government was still in denial; a Washington Post reporter who scouted the morgues to count dead bodies was accused by officials of inflating the numbers. \nOver the next two years, however, the prudence of al-Qaeda\u2019s core leaders began to seem warranted. U.S. President George W. Bush embraced General David Petraeus\u2019s \u201ctroop surge\u201d and the counterinsurgency philosophy that drove it. A counter-rebellion of Sunni tribal leaders already underway was christened the \u201cAwakening\u201d and received new American money and attention. Tribal fighters and U.S. special-operations forces took the fight ruthlessly to al-Qaeda in Iraq, ignoring its rhetoric about an Islamic state. By 2009, the end of the surge years, the movement Zarqawi had created was all but dead. \nBut not quite. A few embers of Zarqawi\u2019s Islamic state remained, kept alive by flickering Sunni rage. The flame was nurtured at U.S.-organized Iraqi prisons such as Camp Bucca, where religious Sunni detainees mingled with former members of Saddam\u2019s Baath Party, and the nucleus of a reborn movement took shape. \u201cEveryone tells me they\u2019ve never seen what\u2019s happening on the ground now. Hell has come to these villages and towns. It\u2019s far worse than before.\u201d \nDid U.S. officials know or care about the fire building beneath the Iraqi state, led at the time by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki? Apparently not. Maliki, a Shiite, was proving corrupt and sectarian in his rule, displacing Sunnis from their few handholds of power in the new state. The Iraqi people sensed that Maliki was wrecking their country, and in March 2010 elections voted out his coalition in favor of a more inclusive group headed by the pro-American former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. \nIn what can only be described as an act of folly, the United States (with Iran as a silent partner) contrived a horse-trading process that kept Maliki in power. Vice President Joe Biden, who was in charge of the dickering, was fond of proclaiming that \u201cpolitics has broken out in Iraq.\u201d Iraqi politicians concluded (probably correctly) that the Obama administration had decided to leave the country to its own machinations. Nobody imagined in Washington (and few seemed to understand in Baghdad) that this future would empower as never before the Islamic State. \nIn the years after Maliki\u2019s 2010 \u201creelection,\u201d the Islamic State engaged in a ruthless campaign of assassination against Sunni tribal leaders and the remnants of the Awakening movement in Iraq\u2019s Anbar province. Between 2009 and 2013, the Islamic State killed 1,345 Awakening members, according to doctoral research by the former U.S. Army officer Craig Whiteside. In Jurf al-Sakhar, a town south of Baghdad, 46 Awakening members were killed in 27 incidents over this four-year period. The slaughter was hardly a secret: ISIS documented the drive-by shootings and point-blank assassinations in a video called \u201c The Clanging of the Swords .\u201d Was anyone watching in Washington? Evidently not. Officials in Baghdad, meanwhile, didn\u2019t seem to care; Maliki\u2019s government was probably as happy to see the killing of potentially powerful Sunnis as was ISIS. \nThe assassination campaign weakened Sunni resistance, helping ISIS seize Mosul in 2014. It helped too that ISIS had used Iraqi prisons as its training camps, building trust, operations security, and a passionate hatred for the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. This was a guerrilla army in waiting, and ISIS staged a campaign called \u201cBreaking the Walls\u201d to free these captives and bring them into the fight. Whiteside estimates that between July 2012 and July 2013, ISIS orchestrated seven major prisons raids, culminating in a spectacular, well-organized breakout at Abu Ghraib. (One of the first things ISIS did after sweeping through Mosul was to liberate the prison there, adding several thousand fighters to its burgeoning ranks.) One graduate of these prisons turned schools for jihad, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is the current leader of ISIS. Pro-ISIS demonstrators march in Mosul, Iraq, in June 2014. (AP) \nPrior to the storming of Mosul, did anyone at senior levels of the Obama administration notice that, as the poet W.H. Auden wrote of the carnage of the Spanish Civil War, \u201cour fever\u2019s menacing shapes are precise and alive\u201d? Apparently not. As U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted in an interview with me in September 2014: \u201cWe underestimated ISIL [the Islamic State] and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi Army. \u2026 I didn\u2019t see the collapse of the Iraqi security force in the north coming. \u2026 It boils down to predicting the will to fight, which is an imponderable.\u201d \nBut ISIS\u2019s potency was certainly clear to Sunni tribal leaders. In April 2014, two months before the capture of Mosul, I interviewed Iraqi sheikhs from Anbar. One of them, Jalal al-Gaood, told me by phone that in his hometown of Albu Ali Jassim, west of Ramadi, violent extremists had attacked a police building, prompting the Iraqi military to bomb and shell the village, and his entire tribe to move out of the area. Gaood offered a grim prediction: \u201cEveryone tells me they\u2019ve never seen what\u2019s happening on the ground now. Hell has come to these villages and towns. It\u2019s far worse than before.\u201d Sheikh Zaydan al-Jabari, a tribal leader from Ramadi, told me that day: \u201cIraq is not now a state. It is led by gangs.\u201d Related Story \nWhat ISIS Really Wants \nBarack Obama couldn\u2019t ignore the capture of Mosul. But even after the U.S. president successfully pushed to replace Maliki with a less sectarian prime minister, America struggled to gain the trust of Sunni leaders and recruit the kind of force that could roll back ISIS\u2019s gains. In October 2014, on the morning after ISIS had gutted the pro-American fighters of his Albu Nimr tribe, Gaood told me that his pleas that night for help from U.S. Central Command had gone unanswered: \u201cEvery time the Iraqis meet with Americans, [the Americans] just take notes,\u201d he complained . \nThat same month, Jabari said that the Sunni tribes again wanted U.S. help and \u201ca strategic relationship with the Americans.\u201d Yet he scoffed at U.S. plans to create a national guard for the Sunnis, saying it was \u201cwishful thinking\u201d because Iraq\u2019s Shiites and Kurds would never agree to the proposal. Until Sunni rights are respected, he said bitterly, \u201cwe will not allow the world to sleep.\u201d His warnings have so far proven correct: The U.S.-backed legislation that would authorize a Sunni national guard remains stalled in the Shiite-dominated Iraqi parliament. A Shiite paramilitary fighter in Tikrit, Iraq, puts Iraqi flags on a wall painted with the black flag commonly used by Islamic State militants. (Reuters) \nI saw Jabari again in June 2015, a few weeks after ISIS had overrun the city of Ramadi (after bland reassurances from U.S. CENTCOM officials that the city would hold). Jabari was seeking support for his tribal fighters. (Like several Anbar sheikhs, he had by now hired his own D.C. lobbying firm.) \n\u201cIraqis don\u2019t want to live under the Islamic State, but where are they supposed to go?\u201d he asked me. Shiite militias had blocked the way to Baghdad for Sunnis fleeing Ramadi; ISIS, meanwhile, was offering amnesty to families who came back to the city and turned over their sons to the Islamic State to fight. These tribal leaders simply do not believe U.S. assurances that America is in this fight for real. The sheikhs are selfish and self-interested, but can you blame them? They\u2019ve been burned too often. The problem with the U.S. anti-ISIS strategy in Iraq is that it depends on a Sunni tribal movement that no longer exists. * * * \nWhat lessons can be drawn from the rise of ISIS in Iraq and the campaign so far against it? \nFirst, anti-ISIS ground and air operations have been successful when they have been launched from areas with strong operational and planning resources and well-trained and motivated fighters. Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region is the obvious example, as I saw on a recent visit: Kurdistan Democratic Party peshmerga fighters under the Barzani clan have pushed ISIS west and south, and squeezed ISIS-held Mosul. A visitor can drive unmolested today into the northern province of Nineveh and over the Mosul Dam, which in the fall of 2014 was in ISIS hands. Patriotic Union of Kurdistan militias have held their own in the northern Kirkuk area, though there\u2019s growing concern among the Kurds and Americans that they are taking orders from Iran and its Quds Force. Similarly, Shiite militias, under Iranian supervision, have fought well in defending Baghdad. \u201cIf you add everything up \u2026 [ISIS] could win. Evil isn\u2019t always defeated.\u201d \nThe problem remains creating a Sunni force that can help the Iraqi military push ISIS from Mosul, Fallujah, and Ramadi, and then hold the retaken ground. Such a force would have to operate from a secure base\u2014not just a logistical base, but a base of trust, in which the Sunnis feel they are fighting for a part of Iraq that will truly be theirs post-ISIS. Iraq\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Lukman Faily, has told me he favors constitutional changes that would create the kind of Iraqi federalism that would truly give Sunnis some \u201cskin in the game\u201d and make a decentralized Iraq work. \nAbsent this essential political component, it\u2019s hard to imagine how the current U.S. strategy against ISIS can work. U.S. military power could drive the heirs of Zarqawi underground, but without Sunni empowerment, the insurgents will be back as ISIS 2.0 or 3.0. It\u2019s now clear that the \u201c80-percent solution\u201d is shorthand for the violent dismemberment of Iraq. If some new political balance that allows Sunnis to govern their land can\u2019t be created in the country, we must reckon with the stark warning of the CIA\u2019s former deputy director, John McLaughlin, to The New York Times : \u201cIf you add everything up \u2026 [ISIS] could win. Evil isn\u2019t always defeated.\u201d The Syrian Roots of ISIS \nDisentangling the story of ISIS\u2019s expansion in Iraq at least produces a coherent narrative. That\u2019s less true in Syria. The spread of the Islamic State there seems, in the famous French dictum, \u201cworse than a crime, a blunder.\u201d We\u2019ll never know whether a more aggressive U.S. policy\u2014arming the moderate Syrian opposition sooner or bombing the Syrian government\u2019s command-and-control infrastructure after President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his people\u2014could have produced a better outcome. But it\u2019s hard to imagine a policy that would have done worse. \nWhere ISIS experienced organic growth in Iraq (in the sense that a metastasizing cancer can be called organic), in Syria it seems more a case of implantation. For all the mistakes in U.S. policy, the regional powers\u2014Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar\u2014have taken truly reckless actions, making Syria a cockpit for their proxy wars. It was Turkey that allowed a southern border with Syria so porous that it offered ISIS and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra what amounted to a logistical safe zone. It was Iran that marched Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia whose mission was fighting Israel, into Syria to save Assad. It was Saudi Arabia and Qatar, jockeying for regional influence, that funded a scattershot array of Sunni militias that proved easy recruiting grounds for the extremists (and in this sense supported the extremists). And it was Russia that stood by while its client, Assad, bombed civilians and ravaged his nation, and then began doing the bombing itself.

(Goran Tomasevic / Reuters) \nRussia\u2019s recent military intervention in Syria\u2014nominally to fight the extremists, but more to prop up a government that protects Russian interests\u2014is power politics in its rawest form. Vladimir Putin understood this summer (as the CIA did) that Assad\u2019s regime was losing ground to Islamic rebel groups. Russian military operations (coordinated with Iran) were focused not on ISIS strongholds in the northeast, but on U.S.- and Saudi-backed forces in the northwest, close to Assad\u2019s Alawite homeland in Latakia. Putin may be angling to strengthen Assad\u2019s hand in anticipation of the political negotiation that both Moscow and Washington say is needed. But so far, the Russian-Iranian partnership with Assad has only deepened the sectarian nature of the war. \nMeanwhile, U.S. strategy in Syria has been so feeble (and its implementation so inept, as in the worst days of the Green Zone) that the United States at this writing seems like a junior partner, with Russia taking the decisive role in shaping the battle against ISIS. \nSyria seems increasingly like one of those Agatha Christie books where every character has had a hand in the crime. \nI first visited Syria in the early 1980s, witnessing the systematic destruction that Assad\u2019s father, Hafez, had visited upon Muslim Brotherhood strongholds in Hama. Later, I was one of many Westerners who had regular conversations with Assad and his advisors between 2000 and 2010 about what the Syrian president claimed was his recognition of the need for political reform in Syria. As a result, I traveled to Damascus from Cairo in February 2011 with great curiosity. In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak\u2019s government had just fallen in the Tahrir Square revolution that marked the apex of the Arab Spring. What would Damascus, scene of so many coups and counter-coups during its modern history, bring to this revolutionary moment? Syria seems like one of those Agatha Christie books where every character has had a hand in the crime. \nAssad\u2019s advisors were buzzing about the president\u2019s plans for reform. He knew his Baath Party was corrupt, one insisted. He knew the power of his relatives, the Makhlouf family, had to be curbed, said another. Reformers confided how on February 19, police had assaulted a driver in downtown Damascus. It was a normal day in authoritarian Damascus\u2014but not in the age of the cell phone and the hashtag. Hundreds quickly gathered in the capital\u2019s streets and began chanting: \u201cWe are the people. The people won\u2019t be humiliated.\u201d Video footage of the drama was posted to the Internet, and made its way into Syrian homes. Syrian officials initially responded wisely. The minister of the interior arrived about 30 minutes after the protest started, apologized to the man who had been beaten, and escorted him away in his car. The police officers were disciplined. The crowd gradually ebbed, and some (doubtless with official encouragement) began chanting Assad\u2019s name. \nThe regime wasn\u2019t so lucky a few weeks later when protests spread to Daraa, the provincial capital south of Damascus. The Houranis (as the people of this region are known) are famously feisty, and they pushed the local police and military hard. The authorities, led by a bullheaded provincial governor, started firing back. Civilians were slaughtered. And the Syrian revolution had begun. \nSeveral factors made this revolution especially disorganized (and prey to manipulation by extremists). First, it was a genuinely bottom-up movement, with each mosque gathering its own young men into brigades to defend the local area and then (in theory) fight a larger war to overthrow the regime. The Muslim Brotherhood, devastated by Hafez al-Assad in 1982, lacked the discipline and organization that could have helped weld a strong opposition. The moderates were hapless. Anti-Syrian government protesters during a demonstration in Homs province in January 2012 (AP) \nSecond, as in Iraq, the revolution arrived in a country that had suppressed deep sectarian divisions. Sunnis appreciated the stability and \u201cArabism\u201d that the Assad regimes had brought, but they felt humiliated by their subservience to leaders who many derided as Alawite bumpkins from the mountains. In light of these tensions, Syrian minorities banded together behind the regime. \nBecause of the disorganization of the opposition, and the sectarian character of Syrian society, the civil war got nastier after 2011. Inevitably, the opposition became more Sunni and proto-jihadist. In October 2012, I traveled inside the country for two days with the help of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), and came to three basic judgments : First, there aren\u2019t enough weapons for the rebels to defeat Assad\u2019s forces, and almost every Syrian I talked to thinks this is America\u2019s fault; second, the commanders of the Free Syrian Army are trying to exercise better command and control over what has been a disorganized, ragtag operation; and third, in this chaotic and under-resourced fight, the power of the Salafist jihadists\u2014who ask only to be martyrs\u2014appears to be growing. \nIt seemed clear that absent U.S. training and assistance of the moderate opposition, these problems would only get worse. \nA CIA covert training program began , sort of, in 2013. Working with the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate (GID), the CIA had some success in building a \u201csouthern front,\u201d but U.S. and Jordanian policy restrained the opposition from any move that might topple Assad prematurely, before his successor was clear. The CIA\u2019s program had even less success in the north. I\u2019ve interviewed most of the pro-American moderate commanders who operated from Turkey: a former military-science professor named Selim Idriss; a loud former Syrian Army colonel named Abdul-Jabar Akaidi; a roustabout guerrilla leader in Idlib named Jamaal Maarouf; and Hamza al-Shamali, the leader of what was the largest CIA-trained force in the north, known as Harakat al-Hazm. \nNone of these Syrian commanders had the military leadership skills or command presence to create an effective opposition. Shamali\u2019s group got chased from its bases in Idlib by the jihadists from Nusra. \u201cAt some point, the Syrian street lost trust in the Free Syrian Army,\u201d Shamali explained to me in a 2014 interview at a safe house along the Turkish border. He bluntly admitted that many FSA commanders weren\u2019t disciplined, FSA fighters were poorly trained, and the loose FSA structure hadn\u2019t provided adequate command-and-control capability. Sadly, he said, \u201cthe question every Syrian has for the opposition is: \u2018Are you going to bring chaos or order?\u2019\u201d A Free Syrian Army fighter throws a bomb toward forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Deir al-Zor, Syria, in December 2013. (Khalil Ashawi / Reuters) \nThe United States tried to bolster these nominally covert Syrian missions with an overt \u201ctrain and equip\u201d program backed by $500 million in congressional support. The program proved a dismal failure, and was terminated by Obama in October. A first \u201cclass\u201d of 54 trainees was inserted into northern Syria in July 2015 and promptly attacked by Nusra fighters. The debacle resulted from poor intelligence about Nusra\u2019s intentions, poor planning about how the U.S.-backed force would operate on the ground, and an unworkable system for vetting recruits that disallowed those who wanted to fight Assad rather than ISIS. The U.S.-backed rebels, in effect, walked into a trap\u2014in a mission that recalled, to some Pentagon officials, the failed Bay of Pigs landing in Cuba in 1961. To me, the botched effort encapsulated all the contradictions and uncertainties of U.S. policy. \nSome in the White House seemed almost to gloat over the collapse of the train-and-equip program, as if this showed that their reluctance to back Syrian rebels had been right all along. How nice it would be if American inaction\u2014and America\u2019s waffling, wobbling approach to Syria\u2014could be described as success. Alas, not so. \nThe extremists of ISIS and al-Qaeda filled the vacuum left by the moderate opposition. Early in the war, the momentum seemed to be with Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate. When I asked an FSA commander in Aleppo in 2012 whether his men fought with Nusra, he answered: \u201cOf course, they\u2019re the best fighters.\u201d If the FSA needed hardened men for an assault, they would turn to the suicide bombers of Nusra, who were often foreign fighters looking for a ticket to paradise. I asked a Syrian doctor what he had learned from treating rebel casualties at the front. A large majority of those with serious wounds were from Nusra, he said. Inevitably, people, arms, and money began flowing to the fighters who were the toughest and best. Assad needed to demonstrate that there was a worse Syrian face than his own\u2014that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS\u2019s leader. \nISIS played a spoiler\u2019s game in Syria. It moved to Raqqa, an area adjacent to its supply lines into Iraq, and used the city as a kind of logistics base camp for its bigger Iraq operations. Raqqa soon became the \u201ccapital\u201d of the \u201cstate,\u201d and the destination for thousands of foreign fighters. It prospered in part because it wasn\u2019t bombed by Assad\u2019s air force, which was leveling every other civilian area under rebel control. \nYou don\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theorist to understand why Assad allowed ISIS to put down roots: He needed a threat to show the West why his regime\u2019s survival mattered; he needed to demonstrate that there was a worse Syrian face than his own\u2014that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS\u2019s leader. (If you are a conspiracy theorist, you would also note the strong intelligence connections that developed between the Syrian Mukhabarat and al-Qaeda in Iraq during the Zarqawi days.) * * * \nSince visiting Syria in 2012, I have believed that the shattered nation can gradually be stabilized if the United States and its allies seriously commit to building a new Syrian force that can help fill the vacuum, post-Assad. But the halfway measures taken by the U.S. thus far have only helped the jihadists. \nFriction between ISIS and Nusra is nearly as strong as the old infighting between Zarqawi and bin Laden. The United States and its allies are doubtless working to exacerbate these cleavages, which suggest that the jihadists\u2019 power can be degraded over time in Syria. Raqqa is now flanked to the north by Syrian Kurdish forces who are receiving ammunition and air support from the United States; as the squeeze intensifies on ISIS forces there, Nusra will have to decide whether it wants to come to the apostates\u2019 aid or let them be pounded. Either way, Nusra will suffer in the eyes of its followers. The U.S. has created enemies that did not exist before 2003; it has fostered a degree of mistrust so acute that many in the Middle East welcome Putin as a deliverer. \nShould the United States and its allies target Nusra and ISIS equally? Prudence argues for a strategy that treats ISIS as the first priority. The toppling of ISIS would curb the momentum of extremist forces more generally. Some Qatari officials have told me they think Nusra can be split into several factions, and that many of its fighters can be co-opted by Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or Turkey into less menacing groups that reject foreign terror operations. This may be wishful thinking, but it\u2019s worth exploring. The message to Nusra should be that attempts to spread terror outside Syria will provoke devastating U.S. and allied attacks. \nWhat\u2019s the pathway out of the Syrian disaster? Based on my reporting, I\u2019d offer several conclusions, which haven\u2019t changed much in the last three years: The best hope for Syria\u2019s survival is a political solution\u2014jointly brokered by the U.S., Russia, Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia\u2014that begins the transition to a new, post-Assad government. But such a political solution will be impossible without a strong, U.S.-backed opposition that can merge with \u201cacceptable\u201d elements of the Syrian army to manage a transition from Assad. This transition process will be fostered by safe zones in the north and south, where humanitarian assistance can be directed, Syrian refugees can return, and political compromise can be rediscovered. If these steps cannot be taken, the result will be the continuing growth of ISIS and other extremist groups, and the full collapse of a fractured Syria into a failed state and terrorist haven. Russian-Iranian military intervention can widen the boundaries of Assad\u2019s rump state, but it cannot rebuild a united Syria. \nISIS\u2019s power will only be enhanced in Syria by Assad\u2019s continued hold on power. That\u2019s why a campaign against ISIS that doesn\u2019t include the goal of bringing new leadership to Syria is short-sighted. And yet fears that a freewheeling regime collapse would give way to warlordism and terror across Syria are justified. For now, Syria offers a grim lesson: Muddled U.S. policies can produce as disastrous an outcome as military intervention. \nMy friend Raja Sidawi was right 12 years ago: America has not changed Iraq or Syria, but the wars there have indeed changed America. Americans have learned the limits of military power and covert action; the U.S. has helped create enemies that did not exist before George W. Bush\u2019s mistaken invasion of Iraq in 2003 (I described my own mistakes in supporting the Iraq War, and explained the lessons I drew from this horrible experience, in a 2013 column ); it has fostered a degree of mistrust so acute that many in the region now welcome the vain autocrat Vladimir Putin as a deliverer. Obama\u2019s policies may have been weak and feckless, but they have reflected a widespread desire among Americans to extricate the country from the Middle East\u2019s long wars. \nAs Russian planes conduct dozens of sorties a day over Syria, the cover of the November/December 2015 issue of Foreign Affairs proclaims: \u201c The Post-American Middle East .\u201d That\u2019s a bit hasty. Nothing in this part of the world is ever really over. But the people of the Middle East finally own their own history. The only people who can fix this mess are the citizens of the region themselves, and it\u2019s going to take a very long time. \nThis article is adapted from a paper for a forthcoming series from the Aspen Strategy Group.

Attacks targeting civilians linked to or inspired by ISIS Since January 2015, outside Iraq and Syria. Circles represent number of deaths of confirmed ISIS-related attacks. Jan. 2015 Paris Attacks \nThe Brussels explosions are the latest attacks to demonstrate a significant leap in the Islamic State\u2019s ability to coordinate operations against the West. In October, the Islamic State downed a Russian passenger jet, killing all 224 people on board. Two weeks later, an assault across Paris killed more than 100 people. \nThe Islamic State has also inspired people to carry out attacks. In December, a woman in San Bernardino, Calif., posted her \u201cbayat,\u201d or oath of allegiance, to the Islamic State on a Facebook page moments before she and her husband opened fire in a conference room, killing 14 people. \nThe couple did not appear to have been directed by the Islamic State, but seemed to have been inspired by the group\u2019s instructions for supporters to attack Western targets. \nWhether inspired or coordinated, these attacks have drawn attention to the growing number of civilian deaths caused by the group outside of Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State has a history of attacking mosques, hotels, busy city streets and other civilian targets in mostly non-Western countries. The civilian death toll outside Iraq and Syria has risen to more than 1,000 since January 2015.

The group is focused on three parallel tracks, according to Harleen Gambhir, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War: \n* inciting regional conflict with attacks in Iraq and Syria; \n* building relationships with jihadist groups that can carry out military operations across the Middle East and North Africa; \n* and inspiring, and sometimes helping, ISIS sympathizers to conduct attacks in the West.

      "text": "More explosive devices reportedly found as Belgian police stage nationwide raids Published March 22, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nMore explosive devices reportedly were turned up Tuesday as police raided homes throughout Belgium in a desperate manhunt for a third suspect believed to have survived the morning's coordinated bombings in Brussels, where at least 34 people were killed. \nIncluded in the haul were several unexploded devices, NBC reported. CBS reported two more devices had been found. \nAt the same time, the death toll in the attacks was raised to 34, according to a Belgian security official who spoke with Associated Press. Related Image Belgian officials released a CCTV image Tuesday showing three men believed to be involved in the Brussels terror attack at the Zaventem Airport. (Belgian law enforcement authorities) \nThe exact number of injured appeared difficult to nail down, with CBS tweeting that it had reached 250, according to the Belgian minister of health. \nAs ISIS claimed credit for the twin, rush-hour attacks, one at Zaventem Airport and the other at a Metro station near European Union headquarters, authorities carried out raids in the capital and in Antwerp that turned up what may be one piece of key evidence. \n\u201cIslamic State fighters carried out a series of bombings with explosive belts and devices on Tuesday, targeting an airport and a central metro station in the center of the Belgian capital Brussels, a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.\u201d \n- Message from ISIS claiming credit for attacks \nThe search of a house in the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek \"led to the discovery of an explosive device containing, among other things, nails,\" said a Belgian federal prosecutor. Also in the home were chemical products and an ISIS flag, according to The Associated Press. \nAuthorities were led to the Schaerbeek home by a taxi driver who had picked the three men up there earlier and driven them to the airport, Sky News reported. Related Image Expand / Contract This image was released on an ISIS-linked Telegram account shortly after the attacks in Brussels. \nLate Tuesday, the State Department warned U.S. citizens about potential risks to travel in Europe, saying \"terrorist groups continue to plan near-term attacks throughout Europe, targeting sporting events, tourist sites, restaurants and transportation.\" \nIt advised citizens to \"exercise vigilance\" in public places or on mass transportation, and advised \"particular caution\" during religious events or large events. \nBelgian authorities released a photo that showed three men pushing carts in the airport, prior to reaching security checkpoints. In the image, two men on the left are each wearing dark clothing with a black glove on their left hands, which authorities believe could have been worn to hide suicide vest ignition devices. \nA third man, seen on the right side of the photo and wearing lighter clothing, no glove and a hat, was the subject of a manhunt after officials said he was seen fleeing the airport following the bombing. It was not clear what role he may have played, but authorities said he is suspected of working with the suicide bombers. \nAn intelligence source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told Fox News' Catherine Herridge that the explosions were set off in aisle three, home to Brussels airlines, and aisle 11, which is Delta. \nHowever, the source emphasized that the bombers appeared to target the highest concentration of passengers checking in - rather than a specific airline - to cause maximum carnage. \nAt least one suicide vest was used during the airport attack, officials have said, and there were reports that authorities detonated an unexploded vest after the attack. \nThe bombings came four days after the arrest of Salah Abdeslam, the primary remaining suspect from November\u2019s attack in Paris. The attacks sent Brussels into full lockdown mode as police carried out multiple raids within the city. \nAbdeslam reportedly stayed in Schaerbeek, the neighborhood where the unexploded bomb and chemicals were reportedly found, for up to three weeks after he fled Paris in November. A more middle-class community than the infamous Muslim enclave of Molenbeek, the western portion of Schaerbeek is home to a large population of Turkish and Morrocan immigrants. \nThe flurry of law enforcement activity came after a channel on the encrypted messaging app Telegram that is maintained by ISIS described the operation and took credit for the carnage. \n\u201cIslamic State fighters carried out a series of bombings with explosive belts and devices on Tuesday, targeting an airport and a central Metro station in the center of the Belgian capital Brussels, a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State,\u201d the message read. \n\u201cIslamic State fighters opened fire inside Zaventem Airport, before several of them detonated their explosive belts, as a martyrdom bomber detonated his explosive belt in the Maalbeek [sic] Metro station. The attacks resulted in more than 230 dead and wounded.\" \nWitnesses said the airport attack, which occurred just after 8 a.m., was accompanied by a shout of \"Allahu Akhbar\" and gunfire. Sources also said it was possible one or more of the explosions emanated from suitcase bombs packed with nails. \nThe claim of responsibility could not be corroborated by authorities, but ISIS has been known to use Telegram for its communications for most of the last year. Telegram is a digital messaging system invented by two Russian brothers now based in Berlin who boast their system encrypts content for storage and transmission. Unlike Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, Telegram does not suspend private accounts or cooperate with government intelligence agencies. \nAlso posted on the ISIS-linked site immediately after the bombing attacks was an image showing a city or a possible composite of several cities with a message warning \u201cWe are already in your city.\u201d \n\u201cThis image is from a new Telegram social media channel posted today after the attack,\u201d said Veryan Khan, editorial director for the U.S.-based Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium. \u201cThere is no caption, but the graphic appears to be a mixture of different cities, including the river -- London\u2019s Thames -- and the rest of the visuals appear to be other cities.\u201d \nThere is reason to be skeptical of the claim, said Ryan Mauro, national security analyst for the Clarion Project and professor of homeland security at Virginia's Liberty University. He said messages and hashtags can be written very quickly after an attack. \n\u201cIt is so obvious that this is ISIS-related, that ISIS accounts who knew nothing about the forthcoming attacks don't risk their credibility very much by claiming credit,\u201d Mauro said. \nBelgium, in particular, and Europe, in general, were reeling following the attack. \n\"What we feared has happened, we were hit by blind attacks,\" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. \n\"We are at war,\u201d French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Tuesday. \u201cWe have been subjected for the last few months in Europe to acts of war.\" \nThe first two explosions rocked the departure hall at the Brussels airport shortly after 8 a.m. local time. Witnesses recounted a harrowing and chaotic scene. \n\u201cFirst there was one explosion. Everyone started to run and panic broke out. Then a second explosion was heard,\u201d one witness told The Brussels Times about the airport explosion. \nZach Mouzoun, who arrived on a flight from Geneva about 10 minutes before the first blast, told BFM television that the second, louder explosion brought down ceilings and ruptured pipes, mixing water with blood from victims. \n\"It was atrocious. The ceilings collapsed,\" he said. \"There was blood everywhere, injured people, bags everywhere.\" \n\"We were walking in the debris. It was a war scene,\" he said. \nAmateur video shown on France's i-Tele television showed passengers -- including a child -- running with a backpack dashing out of the terminal in different directions as they tugged luggage. Belgian news channel RTBF reports a Kalashnikov rifle was found in the departure hall at the airport. \nMarc Noel, 63, was about to board a Delta flight to Atlanta, to return to his home in Raleigh, N.C., when the first explosion was heard. \n\"People were crying, shouting, children. It was a horrible experience,\" he told AP. \nNine Americans were among the injured, including one U.S. service member and five members of his family. \n\u201cSome are critical,\u201d a defense official told Fox News. \nThree Mormon missionaries, identified by the church as Richard Norby, 66; Joseph Empey, 20, and Mason Wells, 19, all of Utah, were also injured at the airport. \nMoments later at the Metro station, another explosion was reported on a train that was stopped at the Maelbeek subway station, not far from the headquarters of the European Union. Ian McCafferty told The Irish Times he was just getting off the metro at the stop before Maelbeek around 8:20 a.m. when he heard a \u201cloud muffled thud\u201d but, because of construction at the metro, he \u201cdidn\u2019t really think much of it. \n\u201cThere was a large military presence and mass confusion,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople started to run. Some people were crying. The two stations are only a stone\u2019s throw apart. We were the last train through the station before the blast.\u201d \nThe bombings in the European Union capital are certain to add new fire to the raging debate over refugees from Muslim nations where terrorist groups are active. Europe has taken in more than a million refugees, and terror groups including ISIS have said they are infiltrating the wave of migrants. \nAfter his arrest on Friday, Abdeslam, who is suspected of taking part in the Nov. 13 Paris attack that killed 130 people, told authorities he had created a new network and was planning new attacks. \nAfter Abdeslam's arrest and before Tuesday's attacks, authorities were frantically hunting a suspect identified as 24-year-old Najim Laachraoui, who allegedly traveled to Hungary with Abdeslam before the Paris attack. It was unclear whether Laachraoui played any role in Tuesday's bombings, but prosecutors say Laachraoui played a key role in recruiting attackers for ISIS. \nU.S. authorities were monitoring the situation, poised to assist in the investigation. Speaking from Havana, President Obama mentioned the attacks before giving prepared comments on the thawing relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. Obama called the attacks \u201coutrageous,\u201d and pledged that the thoughts and prayers of Americans are with the Belgian people. \n\u201cThis is yet another reminder that the world must unite, we must be together, regardless of nationality or race or faith, in fighting the scourge of terrorism,\u201d said Obama, who had also spoken to Michel by phone. \nFrench President Francois Hollande said \"terrorists struck Brussels, but it was Europe that was targeted -- and all the world that is concerned,\" adding that \"this war will be long.\" \nFox News' Malia Zimmerman, Catherine Herridge and Matthew Dean contributed to this report.

      "text": "view example \nHere\u2019s how you can feel like a regular literati!: \nWestern Classics (Ancient & Modern) : to give you a good foundation for the who\u2019s who of Western literature. The Odyssey (Homer): epic of a dude who just can\u2019t get home without a little help from the gods. (Extra credit if you read the Iliad , too!) A Tale of Two Cities (Charles Dickens): the quintessential story of the French Revolution, love, and longing. Pride & Prejudice (Jane Austen): the story that started the \u201chate at first sight turning into love\u201d trope. Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy): Very long. Very melodramatic. Very Russian. Very classic! \nDystopia : the stuff of our worst fears and nightmares. Nineteen-Eighty-Four (George Orwell): the book that introduced \u201cdoublethink\u201d into our lexicon. Brave New World (Aldous Huxley): another classic dystopia. Gammas, Deltas, oh my! The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (Margaret Atwood): a feminist spin on the genre. \nScience Fiction & Fantasy : we can\u2019t overlook the geeky cousin of the classics, can we? The Lord of the Rings series (J.R.R. Tolkien): this guy made the epic (also called high) fantasy genre. Be warned, it\u2019s a bit of a dry read. The Foundation series (Issac Asimov): some of the pioneering stories in science fiction, natch! Neuromancer (William Gibson): here\u2019s something a bit more modern. Plus, you just can\u2019t beat \u201cThe sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel\u201d as a snappy first line. \nGreat American Novels : these zeitgeist works practically defined a time period of U.S. history. The Great Gatsby (F. Scott Fitzgerald): you can\u2019t think of the Jazz Age without thinking of \u201cold sport.\u201d Bonfire of Vanities (Tom Wolfe): the terrible movie nonwithstanding, this book captured the self-indulgence of the 80s NYC crowd. The Grapes of Wrath (John Steinbeck): I dare you to get into a conversation about the Great Depression without thinking of this book. I dare you. \nLiterary Heavy Hitters: books that make people go \u201cWhoa, dude!\u201d when you say that you\u2019ve read them. Ulysses (James Joyce): stream-of-consciousness writing plus an unhealthy sexual obsession with an orphan with a limp equal literary greatness. True story. Infinite Jest (David Foster Wallace): fractals, man! Fractals! Gravity\u2019s Rainbow (Thomas Pynchon): lots of stuff happens that a lot of people pretend to understand. \nPopular Fiction : those guilty indulgences that everyone has read (but won\u2019t necessarily admit to it). Warning: this is U.S.-centric, feel free to indulge in your country\u2019s guilty pleasures. A Song of Ice and Fire series (George R. R. Martin): hey, there\u2019s a popular HBO miniseries about it! The Hunger Games (Suzanne Collins): better than Twilight . Fifty Shades of Grey (E.L. James): be torn between hilarity and despair in this BDSM spin-off of a Twilight fan fiction. Who knows, maybe this\u2019ll spice up the bedroom. \nImmigrant Experience (U.S./U.K.): ah, the magical experience of being thrust into a new culture. Interpreter of Maladies (Jhumpa Lahiri): say hello to our recent Indian arrivals! (For our tea-drinking cousins across the pond, try Monica Ali\u2019s Brick Lane .) Joy Luck Club (Amy Tan): the book that inspired a movie and furor in the Asian American community about stereotypes and Tan\u2019s possible self-loathing. (For a less controversial read, try Ha Jin\u2019s Waiting \u2013and yes, there\u2019s a lot of longing and waiting there.) How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents (Julia Alvarez): how four sisters start to forget their Spanish and their native homeland of the Dominican Republic. \nNon-Western Classics (Ancient) : if Westerners get theirs, so should the rest of the world. Ramayana (India): this is THE Hindu epic. Full stop. Romance of the Three Kingdoms (China): a bit of Chinese history, highly romanticized and dramatized. Kind of like \u201cA World Turns.\u201d \nNon-Western Classics (Modern): the stuff that you should read to feel worldly and well-read. (More applicable if you\u2019re from the U.S. or Western Europe.) One Hundred Years of Solitude (Gabriel Garcia Marquez): this novel single-handedly legitimatized Latin American literature in modern times. Too bad you don\u2019t know who he\u2019s talking about half of the time. To Live (Yu Hua): getting banned in China just adds to its street cred. Things Fall Apart (Chinua Achebe): the sad tale of colonialism in Africa. Definitely merits a frowny-face. \nSatire: throw in a little giggle into your reading list. Cat\u2019s Cradle (Kurt Vonnegut): some say Slaughterhouse-Five is his best, I say this one. Also: Bokononism! Catch-22 (Joseph Heller): come and see what the catch-22 is. I promise you, it\u2019s gorgeously ironic. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams): you kill two birds with two stones here: sci-fi and satire. Whee! \nThis is where I reach the end of my endurance. I haven\u2019t even gotten into the non-fiction stuff, but alas \u2026 I must eat. \nWith this list, you\u2019ll feel like you can dominate the Trivial Pursuit literature section! Life is good. \nPostscript : since this question is more about sentiment than reality \u2026 I hate to break it to you, but if you\u2019re truly a well-read person, you will never feel well-read. They\u2019re always on the lookout for their next book\u2014that category that they\u2019re missing\u2014to add to their impressive list. It\u2019s a Sisyphean goal, really. \nIf you feel well-read, you\u2019re probably not. ",
